# Task ID: 9
# Title: Simplify activeItem State
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Evaluate and potentially simplify the activeItem state and its useEffect.
# Details:
Review the current implementation of activeItem state and its associated useEffect. Determine if it can be simplified or removed by directly using pathname, asPath, and query from useRouter() in useMemo dependencies. Implement the simplification if it doesn't negatively impact stability or cause unnecessary re-renders. If simplification isn't feasible, document the reasons why.

# Test Strategy:
Test the hook with various route changes to verify that breadcrumbs update correctly. Monitor for unnecessary re-renders or other performance issues.
