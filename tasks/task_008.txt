# Task ID: 8
# Title: Consolidate Fetcher Functions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a generic fetcher function to reduce boilerplate in individual fetchers if API patterns allow.
# Details:
Analyze the existing fetcher functions to identify common patterns. Implement a genericFetchName function as suggested in the PRD that can handle most entity name fetching operations. Update the route configurations to use this generic fetcher where appropriate. Maintain type safety throughout. Keep specialized fetchers for routes with unique requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Test the generic fetcher with various entity types to verify it correctly fetches and returns data. Compare results with the original fetcher functions to ensure consistency.
