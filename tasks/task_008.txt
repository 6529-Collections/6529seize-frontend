# Task ID: 8
# Title: Verify state management and event handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure all state management and event handling functionality is preserved after the refactor.
# Details:
Test that the following functionality works correctly: 1) The hasAcknowledged state updates when the checkbox is clicked, 2) The submit button is disabled until the checkbox is checked, 3) The onClose handler is called when the close button is clicked, 4) Any other event handlers or state updates function as expected. Make adjustments if any issues are found.

Verification Log:
- **State (`hasAcknowledged`):** Verified that the `useState` hook, the `useEffect` for resetting state on open, the `onClick`/`onKeyDown` handlers on the custom checkbox, and the `disabled` prop on the primary button all correctly use the `hasAcknowledged` state. Logic appears intact.
- **Event Handlers (`onClose`, `onAccept`):** Verified that `onClose` is correctly passed to `ModalLayout`'s `onCancel`, still used by the footer Cancel button, and used in the Escape key `useEffect`. Verified `onAccept` is still correctly passed to the primary button.
- **`isLoading` Prop:** Verified it's still correctly disabling the checkbox, Cancel button, and Agree button.

**Conclusion:** State management and event handling functionality appear preserved after refactoring.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test all interactive elements and state changes to verify they work exactly as they did before the refactor. Specifically check:
1. The hasAcknowledged state updates correctly with checkbox interaction
2. The useEffect for resetting state on modal open works properly
3. The submit button's disabled state responds to checkbox state
4. The onClose handler works via the Cancel button and Escape key
5. The onAccept handler is properly triggered by the primary button
6. The isLoading prop correctly disables all interactive elements
