# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create breadcrumbs.utils.ts Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Extract utility functions from useBreadcrumbs.ts into a dedicated utils module
# Details:
Create a new file at hooks/breadcrumbs.utils.ts. Move utility functions from useBreadcrumbs.ts including formatCrumbDisplay, getDynamicParam, and buildStaticCrumbs. Import the Crumb type from ../components/breadcrumb/Breadcrumb for use in buildStaticCrumbs. Import any other necessary types from breadcrumbs.types.ts. Export all utility functions with proper export statements. Update useBreadcrumbs.ts to import these utilities from the new file. Ensure all function signatures remain the same to maintain compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the application builds without errors. Test breadcrumb generation for both static and dynamic routes to ensure the utility functions are working correctly. Check that breadcrumb formatting and display remains consistent with the previous implementation.
