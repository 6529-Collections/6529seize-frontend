# Task ID: 3
# Title: Update CreateDropContent.tsx to use the constant
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the CreateDropContent.tsx file to import and use the MAX_DROP_UPLOAD_FILES constant instead of the hardcoded value 4.
# Details:
In components/waves/CreateDropContent.tsx, add an import statement for the MAX_DROP_UPLOAD_FILES constant. Find the handleFileChange function that checks 'updatedFiles.length > 4' and replace the hardcoded 4 with MAX_DROP_UPLOAD_FILES. Also find any instances where the array is sliced using '-4' and replace with `-MAX_DROP_UPLOAD_FILES`. Ensure the functionality remains the same - the component should still limit uploads to 4 files and handle array slicing correctly.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test the drag-and-drop file upload functionality to ensure it still limits uploads to 4 files, shows the correct error message when attempting to upload more than 4 files, and correctly handles array slicing.
