# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Revised determineRouteConfig Function
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the determineRouteConfig function to use the configuration array to find matching route configurations.
# Details:
Rewrite the determineRouteConfig function to iterate through the DYNAMIC_ROUTE_CONFIGS array. For each config, check if the pathPattern matches the current route's primary segment. If it matches, use the paramExtractor to extract parameters. Return the first config that both matches and successfully extracts parameters, along with those parameters. Maintain the function signature to ensure compatibility with existing code. Include fallback logic for routes that don't match any configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests with various route patterns to verify the function correctly identifies route configurations and extracts parameters. Test with both matching and non-matching routes.
