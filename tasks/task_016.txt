# Title: Reset Terms Modal Checkbox State on Modal Open
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the TermsOfServiceModal component to ensure the 'hasAcknowledged' checkbox state is reset to false whenever the modal is opened.
# Details:
In the TermsOfServiceModal.tsx file, update the component to reset the 'hasAcknowledged' state to false whenever the 'isOpen' prop transitions from false to true. This will require implementing a useEffect hook that watches for changes to the 'isOpen' prop and resets the state accordingly. The current implementation likely maintains the checkbox state between modal openings, which creates a confusing user experience. The checkbox should always start unchecked when the modal is freshly opened, requiring users to explicitly acknowledge the terms each time. Be careful to only reset when the modal is opening (transitioning from closed to open), not when it's closing. This may require tracking the previous value of 'isOpen' using a ref or another state variable.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify that the checkbox state is properly reset when the modal is reopened:

1. Manual testing:
   - Open the Terms of Service modal
   - Check the acknowledgment checkbox
   - Close the modal
   - Reopen the modal
   - Verify the checkbox is unchecked

2. Unit testing:
   - Write a test that renders the TermsOfServiceModal component
   - Simulate opening the modal (set isOpen to true)
   - Simulate checking the checkbox
   - Verify the hasAcknowledged state is true
   - Simulate closing the modal (set isOpen to false)
   - Simulate reopening the modal (set isOpen to true again)
   - Verify the hasAcknowledged state has been reset to false

3. Integration testing:
   - Test the component within the actual application flow
   - Verify the reset behavior works in conjunction with other components that might control the modal's visibility
