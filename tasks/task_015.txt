# Task ID: 15
# Title: Accessibility and Functionality Testing for TermsOfServiceModal Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the TermsOfServiceModal component to ensure it meets accessibility standards, has proper UI behavior, and functions correctly across devices and interaction methods.
# Details:
This task involves thorough verification of the TermsOfServiceModal component with a focus on accessibility compliance and user experience. The developer should:

1. Verify the modal implements a proper focus trap that keeps keyboard focus within the modal when open
2. Confirm that the ESC key properly closes the modal
3. Ensure focus returns to the triggering element when the modal closes
4. Validate that all interactive elements within the modal are keyboard accessible
5. Check that the checkbox state correctly controls the enabled/disabled state of the Agree button
6. Verify the modal has proper ARIA attributes including:
   - role="dialog"
   - aria-modal="true"
   - aria-labelledby pointing to the modal title
   - aria-describedby if there's descriptive content
7. Test the responsive layout across multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
8. Verify content within the modal is scrollable via keyboard (arrow keys) when content exceeds the viewport
9. Ensure all text meets color contrast requirements (WCAG AA compliance)
10. Check that the modal renders correctly and maintains functionality across supported browsers

# Test Strategy:
Testing should follow this structured approach:

1. **Keyboard Navigation Testing**:
   - Open the modal and verify Tab and Shift+Tab cycle through all interactive elements without escaping the modal
   - Press ESC key and verify the modal closes
   - After closing, verify focus returns to the element that triggered the modal
   - Test that arrow keys can scroll content when focused on scrollable areas

2. **Screen Reader Testing**:
   - Use VoiceOver (macOS/iOS) and NVDA (Windows) to navigate the modal
   - Verify the modal is announced as a dialog
   - Confirm the modal title is properly announced
   - Check that the modal content is properly conveyed
   - Verify checkbox state changes are announced

3. **Functional Testing**:
   - Verify the checkbox toggles correctly
   - Confirm the Agree button is disabled until checkbox is checked
   - Test that clicking Agree performs the expected action
   - Verify clicking Cancel/Close dismisses the modal

4. **Responsive Testing**:
   - Test on at least 3 viewport sizes: 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1440px (desktop)
   - Verify content remains readable and controls are usable at all sizes
   - Check that scrolling works properly on small screens

5. **Cross-browser Testing**:
   - Verify functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

Document all findings with screenshots and specific recommendations for any issues discovered.
