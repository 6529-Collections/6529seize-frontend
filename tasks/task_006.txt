# Task ID: 6
# Title: Remove redundant layout elements
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove the layout elements from TermsOfServiceModal that are now handled by ModalLayout.
# Details:
Remove the following elements from TermsOfServiceModal as they're now provided by ModalLayout: 1) The outermost div with tw-fixed, tw-inset-0, etc. classes, 2) The main modal container div with tw-bg-iron-800, tw-rounded-lg, etc. classes, 3) The header div containing the h3 title, 4) The explicit close button with faXmark icon. Ensure no functionality is lost in the process.

# Test Strategy:
Compare the rendered output before and after removal to ensure the modal still appears correctly with all necessary elements.
