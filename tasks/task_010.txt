# Title: Add Documentation and Perform Final Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive JSDoc comments and perform final testing of the refactored hook.
# Details:
Add detailed JSDoc comments to all functions, interfaces, and complex logic. Include examples of how to add new route configurations in the future. Create a brief documentation section explaining the architecture of the refactored hook. Perform comprehensive testing of all route types, including edge cases. Verify that the refactored hook produces identical output to the original implementation for all routes.

# Test Strategy:
Review all code for documentation completeness. Test the hook with all supported route types and compare output with the original implementation. Verify performance characteristics to ensure no regressions.
