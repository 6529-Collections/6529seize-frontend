# Task ID: 14
# Title: Unit Test useTermsSignatureFlow Hook Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive unit tests for the useTermsSignatureFlow hook to verify its internal logic, state transitions, and callback handling.
# Details:
Implement unit tests for the useTermsSignatureFlow hook that validate its behavior across different scenarios. The tests should:

1. Verify initial state values (modal closed, acknowledged false)
2. Test the openModal function and confirm it correctly updates state
3. Test the closeModal function and verify it resets state appropriately
4. Verify the setAcknowledged function properly updates the acknowledged state
5. Test the handleAccept function to ensure it calls the onAccept callback with correct parameters
6. Verify the handleClose function properly invokes the onClose callback
7. Test that the hook correctly handles different props configurations (required vs optional terms)
8. Verify proper cleanup on unmount to prevent memory leaks

Use React Testing Library and Jest for implementing these tests. Mock any external dependencies or context providers that the hook might rely on. If the hook uses any API calls, these should be mocked to isolate the hook's logic.

# Test Strategy:
1. Setup testing environment with React Testing Library and necessary mocks
2. Create a test wrapper component that uses the hook and exposes its return values
3. Test initial state values match expected defaults
4. Trigger each function returned by the hook and verify state changes:
   - Call openModal and verify isOpen becomes true
   - Call setAcknowledged(true) and verify acknowledged becomes true
   - Call handleAccept and verify onAccept callback is called with expected arguments
   - Call closeModal and verify isOpen becomes false and acknowledged resets
5. Test edge cases:
   - Calling handleAccept when acknowledged is false
   - Multiple rapid state changes
   - Passing null or undefined callbacks
6. If direct unit testing proves difficult due to hook implementation details, create an integration test with a minimal component that uses the hook, then use component interactions to trigger the hook's functions and observe state changes via rendered UI or debug output.
7. Document any limitations in the testing approach and suggest manual verification steps for aspects that couldn't be automatically tested.
