# Task ID: 12
# Title: Verify Signature Payload Contains Terms Hash and Clear User Context
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure that the cryptographic signature payload includes the terms hash when required and that the signature request presents clear context to users about terms agreement.
# Details:
This task involves verifying that when a user submits to a terms-required wave, the signature payload correctly includes the terms hash in the data being signed. The implementation should:

1. Ensure the terms hash is properly included in the signature payload for any wave that requires terms acceptance
2. Verify that the signature request shown to users in their wallet contains clear contextual information indicating they are agreeing to terms
3. Check that the context message is human-readable and explicitly mentions terms agreement
4. Confirm that waves without terms requirements don't unnecessarily include terms-related data in the signature payload
5. Validate that the terms hash in the payload matches the actual hash of the terms document being agreed to

The signature context should be implemented in a way that helps users understand what they're agreeing to before signing, reducing confusion and potential user errors.

# Test Strategy:
1. Set up a test environment with at least one wave that requires terms acceptance
2. Use browser developer tools to monitor network requests when submitting to the terms-required wave
3. Capture and inspect the signature payload sent to the wallet
4. Verify the payload contains a properly formatted terms hash field
5. Trigger the signature request and capture screenshots of the wallet signature prompt
6. Confirm the signature prompt includes clear language about agreeing to terms
7. Test with multiple wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) to ensure consistent behavior
8. Compare the terms hash in the payload with the expected hash of the terms document
9. Perform a control test with a non-terms wave to verify terms hash is not included when not required
10. Document any discrepancies between expected and actual behavior with screenshots and payload examples
