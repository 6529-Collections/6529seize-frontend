# Task ID: 5
# Title: Document the constant and update code comments
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Add appropriate documentation for the new constant and update any relevant code comments in the modified files.
# Details:
Add a descriptive comment above the MAX_DROP_UPLOAD_FILES constant explaining its purpose and usage. Update any comments in CreateDropActionsRow.tsx and CreateDropContent.tsx that reference the file limit to mention the constant instead of the hardcoded value. If there's a project documentation file or wiki, consider adding a note about this constant for future developers. Ensure code comments accurately reflect the changes made and provide context for why the constant exists.

# Test Strategy:
Review the documentation and comments for clarity, accuracy, and completeness. Ensure they provide sufficient context for future developers to understand the purpose and usage of the constant.
