# Task ID: 5
# Title: Refactor finalCrumbs Calculation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the finalCrumbs memoized calculation to use the crumbBuilder from the active configuration.
# Details:
Modify the finalCrumbs useMemo hook to use the active configuration's crumbBuilder function when available. Pass the extracted parameters, query data, loading state, path segments, and query object to the crumbBuilder. Preserve the existing logic for static routes (buildStaticCrumbs) when no dynamic configuration matches. Ensure the memoization dependencies are correctly set to prevent unnecessary recalculations.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various route configurations to verify the correct crumbs are generated. Compare output with the original implementation to ensure consistency.
