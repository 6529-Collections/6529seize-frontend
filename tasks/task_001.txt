# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create or modify constants file for MAX_DROP_UPLOAD_FILES
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a new constants file or modify an existing one to define the MAX_DROP_UPLOAD_FILES constant with a value of 4.
# Details:
Create a new file at src/lib/constants/uploads.ts if it doesn't exist. If the directory structure doesn't exist, create it. If a similar constants file already exists that would be appropriate for this constant, use that instead. Define the constant as: export const MAX_DROP_UPLOAD_FILES = 4; with an appropriate comment explaining its purpose. Ensure the constant is properly exported so it can be imported by other files.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the constant file exists, contains the MAX_DROP_UPLOAD_FILES constant with value 4, and can be imported from other files in the project.
