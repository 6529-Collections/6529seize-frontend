# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create breadcrumbs.types.ts Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Extract all TypeScript type definitions from useBreadcrumbs.ts into a dedicated types module
# Details:
Create a new file at hooks/breadcrumbs.types.ts. Move all type definitions from useBreadcrumbs.ts including DynamicRouteType, RouteDynamicConfig<TData, TParams>, SpecificDeterminedRouteInfo, DeterminedRouteInfo, and BreadcrumbQueueItem. Export all types with proper export statements. Consider whether to import and re-export the Crumb type from ../components/breadcrumb/Breadcrumb or leave it as a direct import in other files. Update useBreadcrumbs.ts to import these types from the new file. Ensure there are no TypeScript errors after the migration.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the application builds without TypeScript errors. Confirm that useBreadcrumbs.ts correctly imports and uses the types from the new file. Manually test breadcrumb functionality in the application to ensure it still works as expected.
