# Task ID: 1
# Title: Define RouteDynamicConfig Interface and Types
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the TypeScript interface for RouteDynamicConfig and any supporting types needed for the configuration-driven approach.
# Details:
Create the RouteDynamicConfig interface as specified in the PRD, including type parameters for data and params. Define the Crumb interface if it doesn't already exist in the codebase. Ensure all properties are properly typed (pathPattern as RegExp, paramExtractor function, fetcher function, queryKeyBuilder function, crumbBuilder function, and optional parentCrumbs array). Add appropriate JSDoc comments to explain the purpose of each property.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the interface compiles without errors. Create a simple mock implementation to ensure the type constraints work as expected.
