# Task ID: 7
# Title: Migrate Remaining Route Configurations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create RouteDynamicConfig objects for all remaining dynamic route types (nextgen, rememe, meme-lab, collection, wave).
# Details:
Implement configuration objects for nextgen, rememe, meme-lab, collection, and wave routes following the same pattern as the initial configurations. Pay special attention to the wave route if it uses a separate useWaveData hook - either integrate it into the configuration or handle it as a special case. Ensure all existing route patterns are covered. Add these configurations to the DYNAMIC_ROUTE_CONFIGS array.

# Test Strategy:
Test each new configuration with sample routes. Verify that all route types produce the expected breadcrumbs. Pay special attention to complex routes with multiple dynamic segments.
