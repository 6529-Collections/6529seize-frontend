# Title: Adjust content styling for ModalLayout
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the styling of the ModalLayout component to fix vertical alignment issues when used within a flex centering container.
# Details:
The ModalLayout component has styling conflicts that prevent proper vertical centering when used within a flex container. Make the following changes to fix this issue:

1) In `components/waves/memes/submission/layout/ModalLayout.tsx` (around line 20), remove conflicting alignment and height classes from the outermost `div`: `tw-h-full`, `tw-flex`, `tw-flex-col`, `md:tw-block`.
2) Remove conflicting self-alignment classes from the inner `motion.div` (around line 21): `tw-self-end`, `md:tw-self-auto`.
3) After making these changes, verify that the modal content is properly centered when displayed.
4) Ensure the terms content and checkbox are properly spaced.
5) Verify the footer buttons are correctly positioned.

These changes will allow the parent component's (e.g., `TermsOfServiceModal` overlay div) centering styles to take effect properly while maintaining visual consistency with the original design.

# Test Strategy:
1) Visually inspect the modal at different screen sizes to ensure content is properly displayed and spacing is appropriate.
2) Specifically test the vertical centering of the modal when displayed in the overlay.
3) Verify that removing the specified classes doesn't introduce any other layout issues.
