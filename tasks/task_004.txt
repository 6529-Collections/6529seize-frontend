# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Centralized useQuery Hook
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace multiple useQuery hooks with a single centralized hook that uses the active route configuration.
# Details:
Create a centralized useQuery implementation that dynamically derives queryKey and queryFn from the active route configuration. Use the queryKeyBuilder and fetcher functions from the active configuration. Maintain consistent caching strategy (staleTime, refetchOnWindowFocus) with the existing implementation. Handle the case where no configuration is active. Ensure proper typing of query results based on the configuration's TData type parameter.

# Test Strategy:
Test with mock configurations to verify the query is correctly constructed and executed. Verify that caching behavior matches the original implementation.
