# Task ID: 4
# Title: Perform integration testing of file upload functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Test the complete file upload functionality to ensure both upload methods (button and drag-and-drop) correctly enforce the limit using the new constant.
# Details:
Test both file upload methods (button in CreateDropActionsRow.tsx and drag-and-drop in CreateDropContent.tsx) to ensure they correctly enforce the 4-file limit. Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed when attempting to upload more than 4 files. Test edge cases such as uploading exactly 4 files, uploading 0 files, and attempting to upload more than 4 files in various sequences.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test plan covering all upload scenarios: uploading 1-4 files via button, uploading 1-4 files via drag-and-drop, attempting to upload 5+ files via both methods, uploading files in multiple batches that would exceed the limit. Verify correct behavior and error messages in each case.
