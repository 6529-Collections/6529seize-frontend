# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create DYNAMIC_ROUTE_CONFIGS Array Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the array structure that will hold all route configurations, initially as an empty array with the correct typing.
# Details:
Create a constant array named DYNAMIC_ROUTE_CONFIGS with the type RouteDynamicConfig[]. This will be populated with route configurations in later tasks. Add appropriate exports and imports. Include a comment explaining the purpose of this array and how new route configurations should be added.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the array is properly typed and can be imported/exported without TypeScript errors.
