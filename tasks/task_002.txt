# Task ID: 2
# Title: Analyze ModalLayout component interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Examine the ModalLayout component to understand its props, children handling, and styling to ensure proper integration.
# Details:
The analysis of components/waves/memes/submission/layout/ModalLayout.tsx has been completed with the following findings:

1) **Required Props**:
   - `title: string` - Used for the H3 header
   - `onCancel: () => void` - Attached to the top-right close button
   - `children: React.ReactNode` - Rendered as the main content below the header

2) **Children Handling**:
   - Children are rendered directly within a `div` after the header section
   - The component provides overall container padding that children will inherit

3) **Styling & Structure**:
   - Provides the main modal frame (`tw-bg-iron-950`, borders, padding, backdrop-blur)
   - Includes an ambient background effect
   - Implements a standard header with the title
   - Implements a standard close button linked to `onCancel`
   - Uses `framer-motion` components

4) **Integration Considerations**:
   - `ModalLayout` will replace the need for manual implementation of overlay, container, header, and close button in `TermsOfServiceModal`
   - Styling of the children content might need minor adjustments (padding/margin) to fit within `ModalLayout`'s structure

# Test Strategy:
The mapping plan for integrating TermsOfServiceModal with ModalLayout is as follows:

1. Pass hardcoded string "Terms of Service" to `title` prop
2. Pass the existing `onClose` function from `TermsOfServiceModal` to the `onCancel` prop
3. Pass the block containing { scrollable terms div + custom checkbox button + footer buttons div } as the `children` prop

This mapping will ensure proper integration while maintaining the existing functionality of the Terms of Service modal.
