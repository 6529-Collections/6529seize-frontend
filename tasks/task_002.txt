# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create breadcrumbs.api.ts Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Extract all API fetching functions from useBreadcrumbs.ts into a dedicated API module
# Details:
Create a new file at hooks/breadcrumbs.api.ts. Move all API fetching functions from useBreadcrumbs.ts including fetchGradientName, fetchProfileHandle, fetchWaveName, fetchMemeName, fetchNextgenName, fetchRememeName, fetchMemeLabName, and fetchCollectionName. Ensure all necessary imports are included, particularly ../services/api/common-api for the commonApiFetch function, ../constants for contract addresses, and ../entities/INextgen for the NextGenToken type. Export all fetcher functions with proper export statements. Temporarily update useBreadcrumbs.ts to import these functions from the new file (they will later be imported by breadcrumbs.config.ts instead).

# Test Strategy:
Verify the application builds without errors. Test each breadcrumb type that uses API fetching to ensure data is still being retrieved correctly. Check the network tab in browser dev tools to confirm API calls are still being made as expected.
