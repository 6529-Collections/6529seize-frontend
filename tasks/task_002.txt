# Task ID: 2
# Title: Update CreateDropActionsRow.tsx to use the constant
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the CreateDropActionsRow.tsx file to import and use the MAX_DROP_UPLOAD_FILES constant instead of the hardcoded value 4.
# Details:
In components/drops/create/utils/CreateDropActionsRow.tsx, add an import statement for the MAX_DROP_UPLOAD_FILES constant. Find the onChange handler for the file input element that checks 'files.length > 4' and replace the hardcoded 4 with MAX_DROP_UPLOAD_FILES. Ensure the functionality remains the same - the component should still limit uploads to 4 files and display appropriate error messages when the limit is exceeded.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test the file upload functionality through the button to ensure it still limits uploads to 4 files and shows the correct error message when attempting to upload more than 4 files.
