              <b>The Underlying Principles Of These Terms</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              There are two underlying principles of these terms:
              <br />
              <br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Our main ongoing activity is primary minting CC0 NFTs (The
                  Memes, Meme Lab, GenMemes are CC0) with a mission-based focus
                  at fairly affordable prices.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Once the NFTs have been primary minted:
                  <br />
                  a&#41; you and Third Parties can do whatever you want with the
                  NFT
                  <br />
                  and
                  <br />
                  b&#41; we do not have any further obligations toward you
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Most of the Clauses in the Terms relate to making (b)
                  absolutely clear
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  We do not have control of what someone does with The Memes,
                  Meme Lab and GenMemes NFTs after minting, either at the level
                  of the token or the art.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <br />
              &quot;Our Platforms&quot; provide a (hopefully) convenient way to
              see information about 6529 NFTs and their collectors and to
              primary mint NFTs, but they are not the token nor the art. We do
              not make any claims on the token post-minting or on the art for
              the CC0 6529 NFTs, nor do we take any responsibility for either.

              <b>Royalties</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Most 6529 NFTs have secondary sale royalties associated with them
              that are paid to us, the collaborating artist or both.
              <br />
              <br />
              While we have not done so, we reserve the right with no further
              notice to treat NFTs that have paid royalties differently than
              those that have not, in ways to be determined in the future.

              <br />
              Most 6529 NFTs are CC0 (Creative Commons 0) licensed which means
              they are in the public domain.
              <br />
              <br />
              This means anyone in the world can use the image associated with
              your NFT for any purpose they like. Some uses may be perceived by
              you as desirable and some uses may be perceived as undesirable or
              even shocking.
              <br />
              <br />
              This is the nature of CC0 art. There is nothing we or anyone else
              can do about it. If this bothers you, you should probably not buy
              a CC0 NFT.

              <br />
              6529 NFTs do not have any &quot;utility&quot; beyond being works
              of art.

              We may, from time to time, test or operate services that

              These should be considered experimental, subject to change,
              subject to being terminated and, in any case, not changing the
              general principle that we make no commitments to offering
              &quot;utility&quot; to owners of 6529 NFTs.

              <br />
              We may provide from time to time the ability to delegate minting
              from one wallet to another, or to consolidate wallet contents for
              minting purposes. We take no responsibilities for errors, losses
              or missed opportunities relating to air drops or allowlist based
              on delegation or consolidation (or for any other reason).

              What formula or platform we use for delegation or consolidation

              The United States makes it illegal to engage in economic
              transactions with certain people or entities (&quot;Sanctioned
              Parties&quot;)
              <br />
              <br />
              As we prefer not to go to jail, if you are a Sanctioned Party, we
              cannot engage in any economic activities with you.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you are a Sanctioned Party, please do not: a&#41; mint a 6529

              <br />
              <br />
              NFTs are held in self-managed Ethereum wallets where the users are
              responsible for authorizing transactions.
              <br />
              <br />
              Mistakes in how an Ethereum wallet is used can lead to loss of
              your 6529 NFTs (or other tokens), failed transactions or high gas
              costs. Such events are your responsibility and out of our control
              and we cannot offer you compensation or any other recourse for
              such events.
              <br />
              <br />
              There is a vast array of educational resources available to learn
              about how to use Ethereum well. We encourage you to study and
              practice with small amounts before buying economically meaningful
              NFTs and to follow good safety practices such as using
              multi-signature or hardware wallets.

              <br />
              <br />
              It is common for Third Parties to create fake 6529 websites in
              order to convince people to sign malicious transactions or
              transfer their private keys.
              <br />

              We take no responsibility for phishing sites, even if we are made

              Moving them to another blockchain including an &quot;L2&quot;

              If we fail to enforce some of our rights under these Terms in the
              present or against certain parties, that does not mean they
              terminate or are waived. We reserve the right to enforce them in
              the future against any or all parties.

              This means that if a certain section of these Terms is determined
              in some or all jurisdictions to be void, illegal or unenforceable,
              it will be severed from the rest of these Terms and the remainder
              of the contract will continue to be valid and binding.
