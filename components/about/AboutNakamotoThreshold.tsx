          <p>
            The Memes were deliberately designed to be relatively low unit price
            and relatively high edition count.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is important for the overall mission in a large numbers of
            ways. There is no way the mission works with a small number of rich
            collectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interestingly, because people like eye-catching sales, this is one
            of the things that leads people to still underestimate The Memes a
            bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Naka has the highest unit price because it is an awesome card
            (trades around 6ETH now, ATH &gt; 20ETH) but...
          </p>
        </Col>

      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>
            ...if the mission was &quot;maximize unit price&quot;, we could have
            easily dropped some ed: 50 and ed: 10 and ed: 5 and 3 and 2 and 1
            and some of those would have traded at higher unit prices.
          </p>
          <p>
            But not only that does not help what we are trying to do here, it
            hurts it.

            Not today. But soon. This is a thread about the Nakamoto Threshold.
          </p>
          <p>So early on, I said Card #4 would be the lowest edition card.</p>
          <p>
            Seemed like a nice homage to the OG Naka, an appropriate level of
            respect where respect was due.

            To be honest, back then it did not even seem like a hard decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            I knew we would lose some marketing value by not having high unit
            price sales from small editions, but ok, whatever.
          </p>
          <p>Edition sizes were 500, 1,000, 2,000.</p>
          <p>Seemed like a safe hurdle.</p>
          <p>The Nakamoto Threshold: all others will exceed 300 </p>

            Instead of people yelling me for being &quot;elitist&quot; for only
            have edition sizes of 1K to 2K and not expanding (seriously, this
            was a thing for like 3 months), people started disappearing.

      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>We roughly try to match edition sizes to demand.</p>
          <p>
            It is art, not science. Demand is not so predictable and, of course,
            the actual art and actual artist makes a big difference.
          </p>
          <p>Some artists would sell out any edition size instantly.</p>

          <p>
            So we try to find a happy medium between the well-known artists and
            the less well-known artists and that means the edition sizes started
            grinding down.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a few months, they have been averaging in the low three
            hundreds.

            Now, low three hundreds for art editions, three times a week, across
            many artists, in an NFT bear markets isn&apos;t &quot;good&quot;, it
            is &quot;awesome&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            More individual pieces of art are minted on The Memes each week than
            almost anywhere else in the NFT space.

          <p>
            Let&apos;s say, depending on the artist and how the crypto world
            feels that day, a meme card would mint out between 275 to 350 on
            average right now (exceptions exist on both sides).

          <p>
            There was *a lot* of discussion in Discord and basically it boiled
            down to 5 ideas:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Change the threshold</li>
              <li>Mint fewer times per week</li>
              <li>Airdrop to collectors</li>
              <li>I mint them</li>
              <li>Airdrop somewhere else</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </Col>
      </Row>
      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>The first one was the easiest.</p>
          <p>
            &quot;Sure, I said that, but circumstances change, we have to change
            with circumstances. Empires rise and fall, major companies go
            bankrupt, the only sure thing is the heat death of the universe. It
            can&apos;t be that this is the one immutable&quot;
          </p>
        </Col>
      </Row>
      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>
            I gave this option serious consideration because I do think, in many
            things, people should be flexible and adapt to circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>Ultimately, I decided against it for two reasons</p>
          <p>
            First of all, I like to do what I say I am going to do if there is
            any way possible to do it
          </p>
        </Col>
      </Row>
      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>
            And I could see a way to do it. It would be costly to me, but I made
            up the rule in the first place, it is OK if I had to pay a price for
            it.
          </p>
          <p>The second is more subtle.</p>
          <p>
            Even in crypto many things change. The BTC of today is not the BTC
            of Satoshi. Same with Ethereum.
          </p>
        </Col>
      </Row>
      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>But it is important that something stays fixed</p>
          <p>In BTC it is easy, it is 21M BTC.</p>
          <p>
            BTC will live or die based on the 21M issuance schedule never
            changing.
          </p>
          <p>It is the bright line that distinguishes BTC from not-BTC.</p>

          <p>Ethereum faced an important decision of this nature in 2016.</p>
          <p>
            There is a fork (less important now) from the early days (Ethereum
            vs Ethereum Classic) about whether Ethereum should have reorged out
            The DAO attacker.

            So back to The Memes. I asked myself if I had made any absolute
            statements about The Memes.
          </p>
          <p>I concluded that I had made two:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>that they would be CC0</li>
            <li>that card #4 would be the lowest edition count</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So what should we do?</p>
        </Col>
      </Row>
      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p className="font-larger font-bolder">Maintaining the Commitment</p>
          <p>
            I decided that the correct answer is that those two absolutes never
            change.
          </p>
          <p>
            That literally everything else might change, but that those two do
            not change.
          </p>
          <p>The naive view is this is about my personal credibility.</p>
          <p>I think it is actually much subtler than that.</p>

            It is about a group of people (not just me but the artists and
            collectors) agreeing about a hierarchy of decision-making.
          </p>
          <p>No decision is free. Every choice has costs.</p>
          <p>
            Societies coalesce by consensus on which ideals and absolutes they
            will sacrifice for.

            Isn&apos;t this a totally absurd arbitrary number? Of course it is!
          </p>
          <p>
            So is 21 million BTC. 21M BTC does not mean anything. It is an idea,
            it is a myth, it is a meme. It could be 10M or 100M.
          </p>
          <p>
            What matters is ONLY if team BTC sticks to it, that is the magic
            about it.

          <p className="font-larger font-bolder">Managing Tradeoffs</p>
          <p>
            BTC sacrifices many many other things to 21M and its other ideal
            (small blocks for decentralization).
          </p>
          <p>
            There are tradeoffs. This is the necessary element for BTC being
            BTC.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other chains make other tradeoffs which is also correct - we should
            try many things.

        </Col>
      </Row>
      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>
            So BTC has 21M and small blocks. The Memes have the Nakamoto
            Threshold and CC0.
          </p>
          <p>Before people get upset, obviously The Memes are not BTC.</p>
          <p>
            But the social construction process is the same. You have to decide
            what you will sacrifice for.

          <p className="font-larger font-bolder">Implementation Pathways</p>
          <p>
            Once this decision was made, we go to step 2: &quot;how do we
            implement staying above 300 edition size&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first idea &quot;mint fewer times a week&quot; is not a solution
            at all because it just skips the problem altogether.
          </p>
          <p>What if you mint 1x a week and still a card fails to hit 300?</p>

      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>
            The second idea: &quot;airdrop to collectors&quot; is superficially
            a nice idea but, one thing I have learned, is that small partial
            airdrops are a net negative for collector happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            What do I mean? if @6529er airdrops a card to 2K top collectors =
            ok-ish.

      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>
            But here the airdrops would be small - maybe 10 one week, maybe 50
            another week, so any airdrop would leave out 99% of The Memes
            collectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if we used the &apos;fairest&apos; possible formula in the

            And, in practice, what it would mean that several times a week we
            would be having endless cringe discussions of &quot;if the airdrop
            formula was &apos;fair&apos;&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>
            Life is short and I do not intend to spend my life arguing about the
            formula for 0.5 ETH or 1ETH or 2ETH of airdrops.

          <p>
            So time was running out, I was watching a card that would not mint
            out.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to do the only thing 100% under my control and also that
            did not break the absolute rules.
          </p>
          <p>I minted it myself over the 300 Nakamoto Threshold.</p>
        </Col>
      </Row>
      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>And then it happened again, so I minted again.</p>
          <p>
            And this went on for a while and tied up quite a bit of ETH that I
            had other plans for.
          </p>
          <p>
            But my arbitrary rule, when there is no other solution, no better
            solution, I need to pay the price.

          <p className="font-larger font-bolder">Count the Costs</p>
          <p>
            Now what are the costs (beyond ETH)? Some say it is cringe to mint
            your own drops.
          </p>
          <p>
            OK, they are free to have their opinion. I do not think it is
            cringe. I am doing it openly. I like Meme Cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            But even if some people don&apos;t like it, it goes in the
            &apos;sacrifice&apos; bucket.
          </p>
        </Col>
      </Row>
      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>
            Another cost is concentration of ownership of a specific Meme Card.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is true but the Meme Cards are the Lebron James of distributed
            ownership. It is only bad relative to other Meme Cards.
          </p>
          <p>Vs everyone else, we are uber-chads here.</p>
        </Col>
      </Row>
      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>
            Many meme cards have unique ownership in the 80s-90%. The ones that
            I had to mint are generally 60-80%.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are all laughably high numbers. Rare Pepes are worse, as
            punks, ABC, even XCOPY 1/1s. We have tons of room here to spare.
          </p>
        </Col>
      </Row>
      <Row className="pt-3">
        <Col>
          <p>
            The reasons we are so good on distributed ownership is that we are
            obsessed with anti-sybil measures for reasons we will discuss later.
          </p>
          <p>
            So this sacrifice was an easy one to take. Some Meme Cards are A+ on
            unique ownership. Some are B. It is totally fine.

          <p>
            Now, along the way, I was still thinking about what the long-term
            solution could be.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you really believe in a long-term view for The Memes, me minting
            them out is a stopgap.

            What we decided is that in SZN7, at the end of the public phase, any
            cards needed to push edition size to 310 are airdropped to:
            research.6529.eth

            This is an account that will work in the context of the tools we are

            topics, etc.

            Good Decision Making is Hard

          <p>
            Excellent decisions are hard, they need, in fact, a lot of thinking,

            Coming back to the aesthetically pleasing part, what is currently

            All completely voluntary, all culturally driven, not contractually

          <p>
            This is an independent question. You could pick a lower price and
            still not mint out so you still have to resolve the absolute
            question head-on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mint price is not a system absolute like Nakamoto Threshold. In
            principle, it can change in the future.
