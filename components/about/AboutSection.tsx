              Memes are intersubjective myths (hat tip to Harari). Memes are how
              societies organize themselves across large groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              Elections, politics, culture, brands, consumer behavior,
              cash-flows all come from the most powerful memes in society at any
              given point in time.

              those who control the best memes, control societal resources.

              The Memes Collection is focused on the fight for the open
              metaverse (decentralization, community, self-sovereignty) and
              spreading this message. We want many people, many wallets
              spreading this message.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is a collection that is meant to be open and accessible.
              Edition sizes will generally be large and inexpensive, to spread
              the word and to avoid gas wars. They might not sell out right away
              and that is fine, desirable, even. As usual, the 6529 Museum will
              be reserving 10% of each edition to archive, to display, to donate
              or to sell in the future.

              to impose high minting costs on a collection of this nature. The
              collection is minted on a standalone Manifold contract and the
              JPGs are saved on Arweave.

              The 6529 Gradient Collection represents the 6529 symbol in its
              original two stark black (#100) and white (#0) forms as well 98
              grayscale gradients in-between. Each grayscale gradient is a 1%
              increment in darkness between 100% black and 100% white, with the
              background switching from white to black from #49 to #51.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is the artist&apos;s (@6529er) preferred interpretation of his
              work and his vision for it in its purest form. It reminds us of
              the Chromie Squiggles Perfect Spectrums â€“ much less flashy than
              the HyperRainbows, but it is an iykyk choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each of the 100 pieces is represented as a 100% on-chain SVG with
              a secondary IPFS link.

            <p>
              The more mathematically inclined readers will note that #0 to #100
              represents 101 tokens, not 100. That is right, there is a special
              token, #50 that is built different. It is a gif (how could we not
              have a gif?) and, like the squiggles, it moves.

                <br />
                <br />
                Our main ongoing activity is primary minting CC0 NFTs with a
                mission-based focus at fairly affordable prices. <br />
                <br />
                Once the NFTs have been primary minted:
                <br />
                <br />
                a&#41; you and Third Parties can do more or less whatever you
                want with the CC0 NFTs &#40;see details below&#41;
                <br />
                <br />
                and <br />
                <br />
                b&#41; we do not have any further obligations toward you <br />
                <br />
                Most of the Clauses in the Terms relate to making &#40;b&#41;

                The mission of The Meme cards is to effectively make people
                aware of the importance of decentralization.
                <br />

                be disadvantageous to any other perceived goal of the 6529 NFTs,

                <br />
                <br />
                NFTs are the most volatile and experimental sector of the crypto
                field which itself is still a new, volatile and experimental
                field
                <br />
                <br />
                Many things can potentially go wrong with NFTs in general or
                6529-related NFTs in particular, including but not limited to:
                &#40;a&#41; technical flaws/bugs/hacks/vulnerabilities at the
                protocol level, &#40;b&#41; changes at the protocol level,
                &#40;c&#41; changes in which protocols are popular, &#40;d&#41;
                technical flaws/bugs/hacks/vulnerabilities at the wallet level,
                &#40;e&#41; changes in the popularity of NFTs in general or any
                NFTs specifically, &#40;f&#41; technical
                flaws/bugs/hacks/vulnerabilities of project or marketplace
                websites, &#40;g&#41; technical flaws/bugs/hacks/vulnerabilities

                <br />
                <br />
                The future value of art and collectibles is based on demand and
                social factors, is impossible to forecast, and, in any case, is
                out of our control. <br />
                <br />
                We have no idea what the future value &#40;if any&#41; will be
                of 6529 NFTs.

                <b>Royalties</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                Most 6529 NFTs have secondary sale royalties associated with
                them that go to us, the collaborating artist or both.
                <br />
                <br />
                While we have not done so, we reserve the right with no further
                notice to treat NFTs that have paid royalties differently than
                those that have not, in ways to be determined in the future.

                <br />
                <br />
                Most 6529 NFTs are CC0 &#40;Creative Commons 0&#41; licensed
                which means they are in the public domain.
                <br />
                <br />
                This means anyone in the world can use the image associated with
                your NFT for any purpose they like. Some uses may be perceived
                by you as desirable and some uses may be perceived as
                undesirable or even shocking.
                <br />
                <br />
                This is the nature of CC0 art. There is nothing we or anyone
                else can do about it. If this bothers you, you should probably
                not buy a CC0 NFT.

                <br />
                6529 NFTs do not have any &quot;utility&quot; - in other words,
                6529 NFTs do not guarantee you access to any future product or
                service.
                <br />
                <br />
                We may, from time to time, test services that interoperate with
                6529 NFTs.
                <br />
                <br />
                These should be considered experimental, subject to change,
                subject to being terminated and in any cases not changing the
                general principle that we make no commitments to offering

                We may provide from time to time the ability to delegate minting
                from one wallet to another or to consolidate wallet contents for
                minting purposes.

                &#40;&quot;Sanctioned Parties&quot;&#40;
                <br />
                <br />
                As we prefer not to go to jail, if you are a Sanctioned Party,
                we cannot engage in any economic activities with you.

                <br />
                NFTs are held in self-managed Ethereum wallets where the users
                are responsible for authorizing transactions.
                <br />
                <br />
                Mistakes in how an Ethereum wallet is used can lead to loss of
                your 6529 NFTs &#40;or other tokens&#41;, failed transaction or
                high gas costs. Such events are your responsibility and out of
                our control and we cannot offer you compensation or any other
                recourse for such events.

                There is a vast array of educational resources available to
                learn about how to use Ethereum well. We encourage you to study
                and practice with small amounts before buying economically
                meaningful NFTs and to follow good safety practices such as
                using multi-signature or hardware wallets.

                <br />
                It is common for Third Parties to create fake 6529 websites in

              For example, Meme Card #1 is a derivative of Punk 6529, the

            <p>
              We do not have the right to put Punk 6529 into the public domain

              The Gradient NFTs are released under a permissive license, but
              with some provisions to protect end-users from possible risks. In
              general, we do not mind if people use the Gradient NFTs, so long
              as they do not use it in a way that could lead to confusion about
              if the product or service is offered by 6529. Given that we use
              the Gradient as our logo, we are concerned about situations where
              someone might for example run a phishing website with a Gradient
              logo. If we released the Gradient as a CC0 NFT, we would not have
              any recourse in this situation.
            </p>

              Specific examples:
              <ul>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Whether or not you are a Gradient hodler, feel free to use the
                  Gradient in NFTs, other artwork, or physical products, for
                  commercial or non-commercial use, so long as it does not
                  purport to be offered from 6529.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  You are <b>not allowed</b> to use a Gradient to run an online
                  service that may be confused as a 6529-run service, due to the
                  risk of phishing. If you would like to run an online service
                  that includes a Gradient in its branding, you must have our
                  permission first.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Gradient hodlers feel free to use their specific Gradient and
                  Gradient Number &#40;e.g. Gradient #88&#41; in an online
                  service&apos;s branding, so long as the service does not
                  purport to be offered by 6529.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              While we hope the above model will be workable, we reserve the
              right to adjust this license, at our sole discretion. No &quot;IP
              rights&quot; have ever been promised to Gradient hodlers and
              Gradient hodlers should not buy a Gradient based on the
              expectation of any &quot;IP rights&quot;, including the above,
              being available.
