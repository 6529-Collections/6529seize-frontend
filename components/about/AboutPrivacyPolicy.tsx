            <p>
              We have taken all appropriate measures to provide any information

              Under Chapter III of the GDPR you have the following rights:

            <br />
            <p>
              <b>

              <br />
              You have the right to be provided with your data freely and in an
              intelligible and easily accessible form. Following your request,
              we shall provide information without undue delay and in any event
              within one month of receipt of the request. That period may be
              extended where necessary, taking into account the complexity and
              number of requests. In that case we will inform you for the
              reasons of the delay.
            </p>

                from the data subject
              </b>
              <br />
              You have the right to know the contact details of the agent who
              collects your data, the purposes of the processing for which the
              personal data are intended, the legal basis for the processing,
              the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data
              and where applicable the fact that the controller intends to
              transfer personal data to a third country.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <b>Right of access</b>
              <br />
              You have the right to request and receive a copy of your personal
              data undergoing processing. However, for any further copies
              requested, we may charge you a reasonable fee that is based on
              administrative costs.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <b>Right to rectification</b>
              <br />
              You have the right to obtain from us within reasonable time the
              rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <b>Right to erasure (&apos;right to be forgotten&apos;)</b>
              <br />
              There is a right to ask for the erasure of your personal data and
              no longer processed where the personal data are no longer
              necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
              controlled or otherwise processed.
              <br />
              <br />
              Thus, in the cases where we retain and process personal data in
              accordance with the provisions of Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR, we
              may object to such a request and may keep the relevant personal
              data that are required in order for our us to comply with its
              legal obligations or the legal obligations of a Controller that
              cooperates with our us pursuant to the terms of a Data Processing
              Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Right to restriction of processing</b>
              <br />
              We ensure that we have in place a procedure where you have the
              right to restrict the processing of your personal data.
              Nonetheless, for those personal data that are necessary for
              compliance with a legal obligation, we may object to the
              restriction.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Right to data portability</b>
              <br />
              You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you,
              which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and
              machine-readable format and you have the right to transmit those
              data to another controller without hindrance from the controller
              to which the personal data have been provided.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <b>Right to object</b>
              <br />
              You have the right to object to the processing of your personal
              data. However, since we lawfully process such data under Article
              6(1)(c), we will still have the right to process the data.

              <b>Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</b>
              <br />
              You have the right to be subject to a decision solely on automated
              processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects
              concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.
