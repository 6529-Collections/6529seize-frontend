              The Memes and Meme Lab NFTs are released by the artists under a

              This means that, whether or not you own a The Memes or Meme Lab
              NFT, the artists don&apos;t mind if you use the art of The Memes
              or Meme Lab NFT for whatever purpose you like, for commercial or
              non-commercial use, without any requirement to seek permission
              from them.
            </p>
            <p>
              The community term for derivative works based on The Memes is
              &quot;ReMemes&quot;, but you do not have to call your work
              ReMemes. The goal is for the messages embodied in the Meme Cards
              to spread around the world, to different people, in different
              cultures and countries, who speak different languages and have
              different cultural contexts.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is possible that some Meme Cards contain copyrighted elements
              that are not in the public domain. For example, Meme Card #1 is a
              derivative of Punk 6529, the copyright for which is owned by Yuga
              Labs. &#64;
              <a
                href="https://twitter.com/6529er"
                target="_blank"

                6529er
              </a>{" "}
              , the artist, is putting whatever rights he may have in Meme Card
              #1 in the public domain. That means if you use Meme Card #1, he
              will not pursue any claims against you. But he does not have the
              right to put Punk 6529 into the public domain (only Yuga Labs can
              do that). He also cannot authorize use of trademark
              &quot;Cryptopunks&quot; - the trademark is also owned by Yuga
              Labs.

              <b>6529 Gradient</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, we do not mind if people use the Gradient NFTs as we
              have seen them used in some art and memes, but we are concerned
              about people impersonating 6529 (for example, to operate a
              phishing website).
            </p>
            <p>
              Please do not use the Gradient NFTs in a way that could lead to
              confusion about whether any product or service you are selling is
              offered by 6529. For these reasons, we are treating the Gradient
              NFTs differently from The Memes and Meme Lab NFTs at this point in
              time. The Gradient NFTs have not, at this point in time, been
              released under the CC0 license.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are working on a more detailed policy to give more clarity
              around how people can use the Gradient NFTs without getting
              further permissions in advance, but, until then, we reserve all
              &quot;IP&quot; rights in the Gradient NFTs. No &quot;IP
              rights&quot; have ever been promised to Gradient collectors and
              Gradient collectors should not buy a Gradient based on the
              expectation of any &quot;IP rights&quot; being available.
