            Copyright Infringement Notification
          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied in a way
            that constitutes copyright infringement and is accessible through
            the 6529.io service, you may notify 6529 Collection LLC&apos;s
            copyright agent, providing the following information:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act
              on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
              infringed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
              infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online
              site are covered by a single notification, a representative list
              of such works at that site.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or
              to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed
              or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably
              sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.
            </li>
            <li>
              Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider
              to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone
              number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the
              complaining party may be contacted.
            </li>
            <li>
              A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief
              that use of the material in the manner complained of is not
              authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
            </li>
            <li>
              A statement that the information in the notification is accurate,
              and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is
              authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right
              that is allegedly infringed.
