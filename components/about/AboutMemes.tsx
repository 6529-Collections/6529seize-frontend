            <p>Memes are intersubjective myths.</p>
            <p>
              Memes are how all advanced societies organize themselves across
              large groups of people.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Elections, politics, culture, brands, consumer behavior,
              cash-flows all derive from the most powerful memes in society at
              any given point in time.

              <b>The Memes</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Memes is a collection of art NFTs whose goal is to spread the
              message of decentralization, in a way that tweetstorms, policy
              papers and podcasts can&apos;t.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Memes are large edition, CC0 (public domain) NFTs that spread
              far and wide, are remixed, ReMemed, and reinterpreted by the world
              at large.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that permissionless NFTs on decentralized public
              blockchains should used as the default ownership layer for digital
              objects - profile pictures, avatars, art, virtual spaces, game
              objects, identities and so on - and that application providers
              should reference that ownership layer. This is what we call
              &quot;the open metaverse&quot;. We think whether our digital
              objects are recorded in centralized corporate databased or
              user-owned public blockchains is the most consequential technology
              decision in our society right now.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Memes are large edition, CCO (public domain) NFTs that are
              actively encouraged to be spread far and wide, to be remixed, to
              be ReMemed and to be reinterpreted by the world at large.
