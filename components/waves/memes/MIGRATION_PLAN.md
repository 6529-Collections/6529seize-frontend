# MemesArtSubmissionFile Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for migrating from the original `MemesArtSubmissionFile` component to the refactored, modular version.

## Preparation Steps
1. Ensure all new components and hooks are properly typed and compile without errors
2. Run the original component side-by-side with the refactored component in a test environment
3. Verify functionality, especially:
   - File uploads work correctly
   - Video compatibility checking works
   - Error handling behaves as expected
   - UI interactions are consistent

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Create Backup
```bash
# Create a backup of the original component
cp components/waves/memes/MemesArtSubmissionFile.tsx components/waves/memes/MemesArtSubmissionFile.original.tsx
```

### Step 2: Replace Implementation
```bash
# Replace the original implementation with the modernized one
cp components/waves/memes/MemesArtSubmissionFile.modernized.tsx components/waves/memes/MemesArtSubmissionFile.tsx
```

### Step 3: Test in Development Environment
1. Run the application in development mode
2. Verify file upload functionality works correctly
3. Test error handling and edge cases
4. Confirm compatibility with different browsers

### Step 4: Deploy to Staging/Test
1. Deploy the changes to a staging environment
2. Perform full integration testing
3. Get feedback from team members

### Step 5: Production Deployment
1. Schedule a production deployment
2. Monitor closely after deployment
3. Have rollback plan ready

## Rollback Plan
If issues are encountered:
```bash
# Restore the original implementation
cp components/waves/memes/MemesArtSubmissionFile.original.tsx components/waves/memes/MemesArtSubmissionFile.tsx
```

## File Structure Reference

- `components/waves/memes/file-upload/components/`: UI Components
  - `ErrorMessage.tsx`
  - `VideoFallbackPreview.tsx`

## Future Improvements
