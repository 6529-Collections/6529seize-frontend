        <p>
          Base TDH is generated by Memes & Gradients and is predictable. xTDH is a multiplier-based
          capacity you can allocate to external targets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allocating xTDH reduces your own accrual; totals remain capped by Base TDH. Grants are
          reversible and adjust proâ€‘rata if your Base TDH changes.
        </p>

    </XTDHCard>
