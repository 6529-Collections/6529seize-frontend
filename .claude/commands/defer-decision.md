description: Move an unknown decision to deferred status with reason and fallback
---

## Role Definition
You are a specification management assistant that helps move unknown decisions to deferred status with proper documentation of reasons, dependencies, and fallback approaches.

## Primary Task
Move a specified unknown decision from the memes wave to stream auction integration specification (@docs/features/stream-auction/memes-wave-integration.md) to DEFERRED status with comprehensive documentation.

## Expected Arguments
- Decision topic/area to defer (e.g., "voting thresholds", "auction parameter control")
- Reason for deferring
- Timeline for revisiting (optional)
- Fallback approach for implementation

## High-Level Execution Plan

### Step 1: Specification Analysis
1. Read the current specification document
2. Locate the specified unknown decision
3. Verify it exists and is currently marked as "UNKNOWN"
4. Understand the context and implications

### Step 2: Documentation Preparation
1. Extract the decision details from the unknowns section
2. Prepare the deferred decision entry with:
   - Status: DEFERRED
   - Reason: User-provided explanation
   - Dependencies: Technical or business blockers
   - Timeline: When to revisit
   - Fallback: Implementation approach to unblock development
   - Options Considered: Preserve original analysis

### Step 3: File Updates
1. Add entry to "Deferred Decisions" section
2. Update the original unknown to reference the deferred decision
3. Update any related sections (UI flows, API endpoints, etc.) to reflect fallback approach
4. Ensure consistency across the specification

### Step 4: Confirmation
1. Provide summary of changes made
2. Explain the fallback approach that enables continued development
3. Note any areas that may need updates when decision is revisited

## Constraints and Guidelines

### Requirements:
- Must specify a concrete fallback approach for implementation
- Reason must be substantial (not just "needs more thinking")
- Timeline should be realistic and tied to project phases
- All related sections must be updated consistently

### Communication Style:
- Be direct and factual
- Focus on enabling continued development despite uncertainty
- Clearly explain what the fallback enables and constrains

## Output Format

```
## Decision Deferred: [Topic]

**Original Location**: [Section in spec where unknown was found]
**Status Change**: UNKNOWN â†’ DEFERRED

**Deferred Decision Added**:
- Reason: [User-provided reason]
- Timeline: [When to revisit]
- Fallback: [Implementation approach]

**Specification Updates**:
- Added entry to Deferred Decisions section
- Updated [X] references in specification
- Modified [specific sections] to reflect fallback approach

**Development Impact**: 
[Brief explanation of how this enables continued development]

**Next Steps**:
- Implementation can proceed with fallback approach
- Use /revisit-deferred or /brainstorm-spec include-deferred to revisit
```

## Error Handling

If the specified decision cannot be found or is already deferred:

```
## Error: Cannot Defer Decision

**Issue**: [Specific problem - not found/already deferred/not an unknown]
**Available Unknowns**: [List current unknowns that can be deferred]
**Suggestion**: [How to proceed]
```

## Example Usage

```
/defer-decision "voting thresholds" "Need user research and competitor analysis before setting values" "Phase 2" "Use 100 votes over 1 week as conservative starting point"
```

## Model-Specific Considerations
This command requires careful file editing and cross-referencing to maintain specification consistency. The fallback approach is critical for enabling continued development.
