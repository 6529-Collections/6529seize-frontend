# Review Command

Performs focused code review of implementations against requirements, analyzing code quality, security, and integration with existing codebase patterns.

## Usage
```
/review "Plan to add dark mode toggle" "Created ThemeToggle component with localStorage persistence"
/review "Plan for user authentication flow" "Implemented JWT-based auth with refresh tokens"
/review "Plan to add vote animations" "Added useEffect animations in WaveLeaderboardGalleryItemVotes"
/review "Plan to optimize performance" "Added React.memo and useCallback optimizations"
```

## Review Context

### Current Implementation Status

- **Current Branch**: !`git branch --show-current`
- **Build Status**: !`npm run build 2>/dev/null || echo "Build check skipped"`

### Code Quality Assessment
- **TypeScript Errors**: !`npx tsc --noEmit 2>/dev/null || echo "TypeScript check skipped"`
- **Linting Status**: !`npm run lint 2>/dev/null || echo "Lint check skipped"`
- **Test Status**: !`npm test --passWithNoTests 2>/dev/null || echo "Test check skipped"`

### Implementation Analysis
- **Component Count**: !`find components/ -name "*.tsx" | wc -l`

## Prompt

You are a senior software engineer performing a code review. Compare the implementation against the original plan and evaluate quality, security, and integration.

**Original Plan**: $ARGUMENTS

**Review Focus Areas:**

### üéØ Requirements Adherence

#### **Robustness**
- **Error Boundaries**: Are errors properly caught and handled?
- **Loading States**: Are loading and error states handled gracefully?
- **Edge Cases**: Are boundary conditions and edge cases considered?
- **Memory Management**: Are resources properly cleaned up?
- **Browser Compatibility**: Does it work across target browsers?

### üìä Performance Impact

#### **Bundle Analysis**
- **Bundle Size**: Impact on overall bundle size
- **Code Splitting**: Is lazy loading used where appropriate?
- **Dependencies**: Are new dependencies justified and minimal?
- **Tree Shaking**: Are unused exports eliminated?

#### **Runtime Performance**
- **Render Performance**: Are components optimized for frequent updates?
- **Memory Usage**: Are there potential memory leaks or excessive allocations?
- **Network Requests**: Are API calls optimized and cached appropriately?
- **Animation Performance**: Are animations smooth and performant?

### ‚ôø Accessibility & UX

#### **Accessibility Compliance**
- **ARIA Labels**: Are interactive elements properly labeled?
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Can users navigate without a mouse?
- **Screen Reader Support**: Are content changes announced properly?
- **Color Contrast**: Do colors meet accessibility standards?
- **Focus Management**: Is focus properly managed during interactions?

#### **User Experience**
- **Responsive Design**: Does it work well on different screen sizes?
- **Loading States**: Are users informed during async operations?
- **Error Messages**: Are error messages helpful and user-friendly?
- **Intuitive Interface**: Is the interface easy to understand and use?

### üß™ Testing & Documentation

#### **Test Coverage**
- **Unit Tests**: Are components and functions adequately tested?
- **Integration Tests**: Are component interactions tested?
- **Edge Cases**: Are error conditions and boundary cases tested?
- **Accessibility Tests**: Are accessibility features tested?

#### **Documentation Quality**
- **Code Comments**: Are complex implementations documented?
- **Props Documentation**: Are component interfaces documented?
- **Usage Examples**: Are there examples of how to use new features?
- **API Documentation**: Are new APIs properly documented?
