# Development Workflow

This document outlines key practices and steps for successful development and refactoring within this project. It's a living document, intended to be updated as new effective patterns emerge.

## I. Planning & Preparation

1.  **Define Clear Goals:**
    *   Start with a clear understanding of what needs to be achieved (e.g., refactor a specific component, implement a new feature).
    *   Document the "why" â€“ the problems being solved or the benefits of the change.

2.  **Structured Task Breakdown (e.g., using a PRD or Task Management System):**
    *   Break down larger objectives into smaller, manageable tasks.
    *   For significant changes, consider creating a brief Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlining the scope, technical approach, and potential risks.
    *   Each task should have a clear, actionable description.

## II. Implementation & Refactoring Process

1.  **Iterative Development:**
    *   Tackle tasks incrementally. Avoid trying to change too much at once.
    *   Make small, testable changes.
    *   Regularly review progress and be prepared to adjust the plan.

2.  **Focus on Type Safety (TypeScript):**
    *   Leverage TypeScript's features to ensure code robustness.
    *   Define clear interfaces and types for data structures and function signatures.
    *   Aim for strong typing and use features like string literal unions, `as const`, and discriminated unions where appropriate to improve type safety and developer experience.

3.  **Configuration-Driven Architecture (Where Applicable):**
    *   For components or systems that handle multiple variations of similar logic, consider a configuration-driven approach.
    *   Define clear configuration objects/arrays that declaratively describe behavior, rather than relying solely on imperative code (e.g., large switch statements).

4.  **Isolate Changes:**
    *   When refactoring, try to update one logical part of the system at a time.
    *   Ensure a section is stable before moving to refactor dependent parts. Temporary type casts (e.g., `as any`) can be acceptable for bridging to not-yet-refactored code, with a plan to address them.

5.  **Continuous Feedback & Communication:**
    *   If working with others (including AI assistants), maintain clear communication.
    *   Provide timely feedback on proposed changes.
    *   Ask clarifying questions early to avoid misunderstandings.

## III. Code Quality & Maintenance

1.  **Systematic Cleanup:**
    *   After major changes or feature completion, dedicate time to remove dead or obsolete code.
    *   Clean up unnecessary comments.

2.  **Documentation (JSDoc / Comments):**
    *   Ensure JSDoc comments for functions, interfaces, and complex logic are clear, accurate, and up-to-date.
    *   Explain the "why" behind complex decisions in comments if the code itself isn't self-explanatory.

3.  **Thorough Testing:**
    *   Manually test all affected paths and edge cases after changes.
    *   (Future consideration: Implement automated tests for critical components.)

4.  **Adherence to Project Guidelines & Conventions:**
    *   Follow established coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns for consistency.

## IV. Learning & Improvement

*   After completing a significant task or refactor, reflect on the process.
*   Identify what worked well and what could be improved.
*   Update this workflow document with new learnings and effective practices.
