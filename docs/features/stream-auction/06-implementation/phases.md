### Mobile Specific
- [ ] Touch-optimized bid interface
- [ ] Push notification integration
- [ ] Deep linking from notifications
- [ ] Offline bid queuing

### Deliverables
- Full notification system
- Mobile-optimized experience
- User dashboard complete
- Performance optimized

## Phase 4: Polish & Launch (Weeks 11-12)

### Goals
Final testing, bug fixes, and production deployment.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Complete E2E test suite
- [ ] Load testing on auction endpoints
- [ ] Security audit of bid flow
- [ ] Mobile device testing (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

### Documentation Tasks
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] API documentation updates
- [ ] Operational runbooks
- [ ] Training materials for support

### Launch Tasks
- [ ] Production contract deployment
- [ ] Database migration to production
- [ ] Configure monitoring/alerts
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan
- [ ] Launch announcement preparation

### Deliverables
- Production-ready system
- Complete documentation
- Monitoring in place
- Successful launch

## Dependencies & Risks

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Smart Contract Deployment**: Must be complete before Phase 2
2. **TDH Signer Access**: Required for auction creation
3. **Manual Process Definition**: Team member assignment for DMs
4. **Voting Threshold Analysis**: Can be deferred with fallback values

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Smart contract delays | High | Start contract work in parallel with Phase 1 |
| Performance issues | Medium | Implement caching early, load test throughout |
| User adoption | Medium | Beta test with selected creators |
| Mobile complexity | Medium | Prioritize core mobile features only |

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1
- [ ] 100% eligible drops show badge
- [ ] <1s eligibility check response time
- [ ] Zero false eligibility detections

### Phase 2
- [ ] Successful redirect in <5 seconds
- [ ] Accurate vote refunds
- [ ] Real-time bid updates <100ms

### Phase 3
- [ ] Mobile bid completion <15 seconds
- [ ] 100% notification delivery
- [ ] <2s page load times

### Phase 4
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in production
- [ ] 99.9% uptime first week
- [ ] Positive user feedback

## Team Allocation

### Suggested Team Structure
- **Backend**: 2 engineers
- **Frontend**: 2 engineers  
- **Smart Contracts**: 1 engineer
- **Design**: 1 designer (part-time)
- **Product**: 1 PM
- **QA**: 1 tester (Phases 3-4)

### Key Milestones
1. **Week 3**: Eligibility detection live (beta)
2. **Week 7**: Full redirect flow complete
3. **Week 10**: Mobile experience ready
4. **Week 12**: Production launch

## Post-Launch Roadmap

- Gather user feedback
- Fix any critical issues
- Optimize based on usage patterns

### Month 2-3
- Implement deferred features
- A/B test voting thresholds
- Add analytics dashboard
- Consider additional features

### Future Enhancements
