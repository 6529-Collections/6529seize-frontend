# From Meme to Auction

Here's exactly what happens when you turn a meme into an auction.

## The Flow

```
Post Meme → Get Votes → See Eligible Badge → Choose to Redirect → Auction Goes Live → Someone Wins
```

## Step by Step

### 1. You Post a Meme
Just like always. Nothing different. Upload your meme to the wave and wait for votes.

### 2. People Vote
Community members use their TDH to vote for your meme. The system quietly tracks how you're doing.

### 3. You Hit the Threshold
Once you get enough votes, boom - a "Stream Eligible" badge appears on your meme. You'll get a notification too.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Meme Content]           [🎯 Stream]│
│                         [Eligible] │
│                                     │
│ Votes: 150 | Voters: 42            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. Decision Time
Now you choose. Keep competing for the leaderboard or turn it into an auction?

The system shows you:
- Everyone who voted gets their TDH back
- Your auction details (starting price, duration)
- Once you redirect, you can't undo it

### 5. You Pull the Trigger
Hit confirm and things happen fast:
- Your meme disappears from the leaderboard
- Everyone who voted gets their TDH back instantly
- The system announces your redirect in the wave
- Your auction enters the queue

### 6. Quick Check
Within 1-3 days, someone from the team DMs you to verify everything's good with your content and set up the auction details.

### 7. Your Auction Goes Live
Now everyone can see it in Collections > Stream Auctions.
- Starts at the configured price
- Runs for the set duration
- Anyone can bid

### 8. The Bidding War
Collectors find your auction and start bidding. Each bid has to beat the previous one by at least 5%.

You watch the action:
- Get notified for each new bid
- Can interact with bidders in the Stream Auction Activity wave
- See your meme's value climb (hopefully)

Bidders get alerts when someone outbids them.

### 9. Time's Up
When the auction duration ends, highest bidder wins. Both you and the winner get notified about the final sale price.

### 10. Claiming the NFT
The winner goes to the auction page and claims their 1/1 NFT. It transfers straight to their wallet. You get paid. Everyone's happy.

## What If You Don't Redirect?

### You Keep the Badge
If you're eligible but don't redirect:
- Your meme stays in the leaderboard race
- The badge stays visible
- You can redirect anytime later - no rush

### Never Hit the Threshold?
If you don't get enough votes:
- Your meme lives its normal life in the wave
- Might still win the leaderboard other ways
- But no auction option for you

## The Big Decisions

### Creators Think About:
- Should I redirect now or wait?
- Is this the right time to maximize value?
- Will my meme do better as a 1/1 or competing for the top spot?

### Collectors Think About:
- Where do I find these auctions?
- How much should I bid?
- Who else is bidding against me?

## Different Types of Players

We see four main approaches:

**The Monetizer**: Sees that eligible badge, redirects immediately. Cash is king.

**The Competitor**: Only redirects if they're clearly not winning the leaderboard. Glory first, money second.

**The Artist**: Carefully picks which pieces deserve to be 1/1s. Quality over quantity.

**The Strategist**: Watches community reactions, times their redirect perfectly for maximum value.
