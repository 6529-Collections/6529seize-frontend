# Stream Auction Feature Overview

## The Problem We're Solving

Currently, when someone creates a meme that resonates strongly with the community, they have limited options:
- Win the leaderboard and get their meme minted as an open edition
- Lose the leaderboard competition and get nothing

There's no middle path for creators whose content is exceptional but might not win the overall competition. This leaves value on the table for both creators and collectors who want to own unique pieces.

## Our Solution

We're introducing a "redirect to auction" feature that allows creators to convert their successful memes into 1/1 NFT auctions. This provides:

- **For Creators**: A monetization path for popular content
- **For Collectors**: Access to unique pieces from their favorite creators
- **For the Ecosystem**: More diverse participation models

## How It Works in Simple Terms

1. **Create & Share**: Post a meme to the wave as normal
2. **Community Votes**: The meme gains traction through voting
3. **Eligibility**: Once it hits certain thresholds, it becomes "stream eligible"
4. **Creator Choice**: The creator can choose to redirect to an auction
5. **Auction Process**: The meme becomes a 1/1 NFT that collectors can bid on
6. **Final Sale**: Highest bidder wins, creator gets paid

## Key Principles

### Creator Empowerment
The decision to redirect is entirely in the creator's hands. We show them when they're eligible but never force the choice.

### Transparency
All redirected memes are announced in the original wave, and auctions are visible to the entire community.

### Finality
Once a creator chooses to redirect, the decision is permanent. This encourages thoughtful decision-making.

### Fairness
Voters who supported the meme get their voting tokens refunded when a redirect happens, just like when a meme wins the leaderboard.

## What Makes This Special

Unlike traditional NFT platforms where everything is for sale, this system requires community validation first. Only memes that resonate with voters can become auctions, creating a quality filter powered by the community itself.
