# Stream Auction Feature Overview

## The Problem

Right now, if you create a meme that people love, you've got two outcomes:
- Win the leaderboard → your meme becomes an open edition
- Don't win → you get nothing

That's it. Even if your meme is amazing and gets tons of votes, if someone else wins that round, you're out of luck. Meanwhile, collectors who'd pay good money for your work as a 1/1 can't get it.

## The Solution

If your meme gets enough community support, you can redirect it to become a 1/1 auction instead of competing on the leaderboard. 

This changes everything. Creators can monetize popular work even if they don't win. Collectors can bid on unique pieces they actually want. The whole ecosystem gets more interesting.

## How It Works

1. Post your meme to the wave like always
2. People vote for it because they like it
3. Once you hit the vote threshold, you see a "Stream Eligible" badge
4. You decide: keep competing for the leaderboard or redirect to auction?
5. If you redirect, your meme becomes a 1/1 NFT auction
6. Collectors bid, highest bidder wins, you get paid

## Key Principles

### Your Choice, Always
Nobody forces you to redirect. We just show you when you're eligible. You decide what's best for your work.

### Everything's Public
When someone redirects, it gets announced in the wave. All auctions are visible. No hidden deals.

### No Take-backs
Once you redirect, that's it. Can't change your mind. This keeps things clean and makes people think before they act.

### Voters Get Refunded
If you redirect, everyone who voted for you gets their voting TDH back. Same as if you'd won the leaderboard. Nobody loses out.

## Why This Works

Most NFT platforms let anyone list anything. Here, you need real community support first. If people don't vote for your meme, you can't auction it. The community decides what's worth collecting, not just the creator.
