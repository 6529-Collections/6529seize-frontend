### 2. Alternative Path
**Mental Model**: "I want to try something different"  
**User Type**: Experimenters and innovators

## Secondary Considerations

### Timing Strategies

- Redirect only if not winning

**Strategic Redirectors**: Time based on external factors

- Wait for optimal audience attention
- Coordinate with other activities

### Risk Perceptions

- Trust the auction process
- Confident in their content value

**High Risk Perception**:
- Worry about auction failure
- Prefer known leaderboard system
- Need more education/examples

## Addressing Different Motivations

### In Eligibility Messaging

For **Monetizers**: "Your meme is eligible for auction - potential to earn ETH"

For **Experimenters**: "Try something new - convert to exclusive 1/1 NFT"

For **Community-Focused**: "Strong community support - they want to collect this"

For **Quality-Focused**: "Exceptional content - preserve as unique artwork"

### In Confirmation Flows

**Build Confidence** by showing:
- Voting metrics as validation
- Clear auction parameters
- Simple next steps
- Reversal isn't possible (encourages commitment)

**Reduce Anxiety** by:
- Explaining the manual verification process
- Showing timeline clearly

## Design Principles

1. **No Pressure**: Present opportunity, not obligation
2. **Full Transparency**: Show all consequences upfront
3. **Celebrate Achievement**: Eligibility is an accomplishment
4. **Support Decision**: Whatever they choose is valid

## Common Questions by Motivation Type

### Monetizers Ask:
- "How much can I earn?"
- "When do I get paid?"
- "What are the fees?"

### Experimenters Ask:
- "How is this different?"
- "Who buys these?"
- "Can I do both?"

### Community-Focused Ask:
- "Will my supporters bid?"
- "How do I promote this?"
- "Can voters become buyers?"

### Quality-Focused Ask:
- "Is this prestigious?"
- "How is value determined?"
- "What happens long-term?"
