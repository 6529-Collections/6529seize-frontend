# Why Creators Redirect

We see different types of creators making this choice for different reasons. Here's what drives them.

## The Main Types

### The Money Makers
These creators see that eligible badge and think "finally, I can get paid for this one."

They want to know:
- How much could I make?
- How does the auction actually work?
- Is this legit?

So we show them auction details upfront and maybe some examples of what others have earned.

### The Experimenters
These folks just want to try the new thing. They're bored with the regular leaderboard grind.

They're thinking:
- What makes this different?
- Who's buying these?
- Is this as good as winning the leaderboard?

We need to explain that 1/1s hit different than open editions, and that's perfectly valid.

### The Community Players
These creators redirect because they can feel the community wants it. They see those votes and know people would pay for a 1/1.

They care about:
- Will my supporters actually bid?
- Who's interested in owning this?
- Is there real demand?

The vote count itself is their signal - lots of votes means lots of potential bidders.

### The Artists
These creators look at their meme and think "this one's special." They want it to be a 1/1 because it deserves that status.

What matters to them:
- Is this prestigious?
- Will it be valued long-term?
- Does 1/1 mean something here?

They see the auction as recognition that their work is art, not just another meme.

## When They Pull the Trigger

### The Quick Clickers
See the badge, click redirect. Done. They know what they want and don't overthink it.

### The Wait-and-See Crowd
These folks watch the leaderboard first. If they realize they're not going to win, then they redirect. It's their backup plan.

### The Strategists
They time everything. Maybe they wait for the weekend when more collectors are online. Or they coordinate with other drops. They're playing 4D chess.

## How They See Risk

Some creators see this as free money - "I already got the votes, now I can get paid too." They're all in.

Others worry - "What if nobody bids? What if I could've won the leaderboard?" They need more convincing, more examples of successful auctions.

## What This Means for Messaging

When that eligibility badge shows up, we can't use one-size-fits-all messaging.

For money makers: Focus on the ETH opportunity
For experimenters: Highlight what makes this different  
For community players: Show those vote numbers
For artists: Talk about 1/1 prestige

In the confirmation flow, we need to:
- Show the votes they earned (validation!)
- Be super clear about what happens next
- Make it obvious this is permanent
- Let them know we've got their back through the process

## The Golden Rules

1. Never push anyone to redirect - it's just an option
2. Be totally upfront about what happens
3. Getting eligible is an achievement worth celebrating
4. Whatever they choose is the right choice

## What They Actually Ask

**Money Makers**: "How much?" "When do I get paid?" "Any fees?"

**Experimenters**: "What's different about this?" "Who buys these?"

**Community Players**: "Will my voters bid?" "How do I let them know?"

**Artists**: "Is this respected?" "Will it hold value?"
