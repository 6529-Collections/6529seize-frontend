# Memes Wave to Stream Auction Integration

## Quick Summary
Popular memes can become 1/1 NFT auctions. When your meme gets enough community votes, you can turn it into an auction instead of competing on the regular leaderboard.

## What This Does
Instead of just competing for leaderboard spots, creators get a new choice when their memes perform well. You can redirect your popular meme to become a unique NFT that people can bid on.
