# Memes Wave to Stream Auction Integration

## Quick Summary
This feature allows successful memes wave submissions to be converted into 1/1 NFT auctions, providing creators a path to monetize popular content while maintaining the integrity of the memes wave ecosystem.

## What This Does
When a meme receives strong community support through voting, the creator gains the option to redirect it from the standard leaderboard competition to a unique NFT auction. This creates a monetization opportunity for exceptional content that resonates with the community.
