# Finding Stream Auctions

Here's how people discover and browse auctions across the platform.

## Where to Look

The main spot is in Collections. You'll see Stream Auctions right there with the other collections:
- The Memes
- Gradient
- NextGen
- **Stream Auctions** (that's us!)

Just go to `/collections/stream-auctions` or pick it from the Collections dropdown.

## The Main Page

Here's what you see when you land on the auctions page:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stream Auctions                         │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────── │
│ [Active (12)] [Upcoming (3)] [Completed] [My Bids (2)]│
│                                         │
│ Filters: [Price Range] [Ending Soon] [↓]│
│ ─────────────────────────────────────── │
│                                         │

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The Different Tabs

**Active** - What's live right now. Shows current bid and time left. Little icons tell you if you're winning (👑) or if it's ending soon (⚡).

**Upcoming** - Auctions being set up. Shows "Coming Soon" while the team works with creators.

**Completed** - Past auctions. See what sold for how much.

**My Bids** - Just the ones you're in. Quick way to check if you're still winning or need to bid again.

## What Each Auction Shows

Here's a typical auction card:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ [Meme Image/Preview]│
│                     │
│ Current Bid: 1.2 ETH│
│ Time Left: 2h 15m   │
│ Bidders: 7 [→]      │
│                     │
│ by @creator         │
│ ─────────────────── │
│ [Place Bid]    👑   │
└─────────────────────┘
```

Each card shows:
- The meme itself
- Current bid (updates live)
- Time counting down
- How many people have bid (click [→] for bid history)
- Who created it

Icons mean things:
- 👑 = You're winning this one
- ⚡ = Ending in less than an hour
- 🔥 = Lots of bidding action

## Finding What You Want

### Filters
- Price range (set min/max)
- Time left (ending soon)
- Specific creators
- Has bids or not

### Sorting
Default is ending soonest first, but you can also sort by:
- Price (low to high or high to low)
- Newest additions
- Most popular (bid count)

## Search

You can search for:
- Creator names
- Text in the meme
- Auction IDs

Your filters stay active while searching, and results show which category each auction is in (active, upcoming, or completed).

## When You Click on an Auction

Here's what the auction page looks like:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ← Back to Auctions                      │
│                                         │
│ ┌─────────────┐  Meme Title            │
│ │             │  by @creator            │
│ │   [Meme]    │                        │
│ │             │  Current Bid: 2.5 ETH  │
│ └─────────────┘  Time Left: 1h 23m     │
│                                         │
│ Bid History               Your Status   │
│ ─────────────            ────────────  │
│ 2.5 ETH - @user1         🔴 Outbid     │
│ 2.2 ETH - @you           Last: 2.2 ETH │
│ 2.0 ETH - @user2                       │
│                          [Bid 2.8 ETH]  │
│                                         │
│ Description                             │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────── │
│ [Original meme context and metadata]    │
│                                         │
│ Stats                                   │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────── │
│ Original Votes: 187                     │
│ Voters: 43                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Main parts:
- Big meme image on the left
- Current bid and time counting down
- Recent bids (you can see who's competing)
- Your status (are you winning or losing?)
- Original context from when it was in the wave
- Big bid button ready to go

## Where Else You'll See Auctions

### On the Homepage
Right on the main page, you'll see a "Live Stream Auctions" section with a carousel showing 6-8 auctions. We prioritize ones ending soon so you don't miss out. There's a "View All" link to see everything.

### When Viewing an Auction
At the bottom of each auction page, we show related ones:
- More from this creator
- Others in the same price range
- Auctions ending around the same time

### In the Activity Feed
The Stream Auction Activity wave is where all the action happens:
- New auctions going live
- Big bids happening
- "Ending in 10 minutes!" alerts
- Final sale prices

This is also where bidders and creators can chat about the auctions.

## Works Great on Your Phone

The grid adjusts automatically:
- Desktop: 4 auctions across
- Tablet: 2 across
- Phone: Single column

On mobile, filters collapse into a panel you can expand. The most important ones (price, ending soon) stay visible. Everything else tucks away but is easy to get to.

All the buttons are big enough for thumbs, and the important info (current bid, time left) is right up front.
