# API Tool

API Tool docs cover user-facing guidance for `/tools` routes: the API guide,
Block Finder, and The Memes subscriptions report.

## Overview

- `/tools/api` explains authentication, key terminology, and multipart media
  drop requests.
- `/tools/block-finder` predicts block numbers for timestamps and inclusion
  sequences.
- `/tools/subscriptions-report` shows upcoming and redeemed The Memes
  subscription counts.

## Features

- [API Authentication and Media Drop Flow](feature-api-authentication-and-media-drop-flow.md)
- [Block Finder](feature-block-finder.md)
- [Memes Subscriptions Report](feature-memes-subscriptions-report.md)

## Flows

- Route-specific user journeys are documented in each feature page in this area.

## Troubleshooting

- Each feature page owns its loading, empty, failure, and retry guidance because
  backend dependencies differ by route.

## Stubs

- None.
