# TDH Historic Boosts

Parent: [Network Index](README.md)

## Overview

`TDH Historic Boosts` archives previous TDH booster versions for reference.

## Location in the Site

- Route: `/network/tdh/historic-boosts`
- Primary in-page purpose: historical reference for TDH versions that are no
  longer current.
- Historic 1.3 card label: `TDH 1.3 (March 29, 2024 — October 9, 2025)`

## Entry Points

- Open `/network/tdh/historic-boosts` directly.
- Select `View Historic Boosts` on `/network/tdh`.

## User Journey

1. Open `/network/tdh/historic-boosts`.
2. Expand the version block needed (`TDH 1.3 (March 29, 2024 — October 9,
   2025)`, `TDH 1.2`, `TDH 1.1`).
3. Review Category A/B/C rules for that archived period.
4. Use bottom links to return to current `TDH`, open `Definitions`, or move to
   `Network Stats` and `Levels`.

## Common Scenarios

- Compare older booster multipliers against current TDH behavior.
- Confirm the handoff point between archived `TDH 1.3` (through October 9,
  2025) and current `TDH 1.4` (from October 10, 2025).
- Review which season set bonuses were active in each archived version.
- Confirm historic gradient cap behavior (`up to 3`) for older rule sets.

## Edge Cases

- Historic versions are displayed inside collapsed sections; users must expand a
  section to read details.
- This page does not include the current `TDH 1.4` rule block; current rules
  live on `/network/tdh`.

## Failure and Recovery

- If an archived section is accidentally collapsed, users can reopen it without
  leaving the route.
- If route loading fails, users can recover by opening `Network -> TDH` and
  navigating again via `View Historic Boosts`.

## Limitations / Notes

- Historic content is reference-only and does not represent current boost logic.
- The page does not provide per-wallet history charts; those remain in profile
  `Stats -> TDH History`.
