# Profiles

## Overview

Profiles docs are split into focused subareas so routing, tab behavior,
about-route references, and troubleshooting can scale without a single
oversized index.

## Features

- [Navigation](navigation/README.md): profile route model, tab availability,
  canonical redirects, and header behavior.
- [Tabs](tabs/README.md): per-tab behavior for Brain, Identity (Rep + NIC),
  Collected, Stats, Subscriptions, plus tab-content coverage tracking.
- [About](about/README.md): `/about/primary-address` behavior and reference-table
  expectations.

## Flows

- [Profile Navigation Flow](navigation/flow-navigation.md)

## Troubleshooting

- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/README.md)

## Stubs

- [Profile Tab Content](tabs/feature-tab-content.md): tracks not-yet-documented
  behavior for Proxy, Groups, Waves, and Followers tabs.
