# Claude Code Project Configuration

This document contains project-specific instructions and guidelines for Claude Code interactions.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This is a Next.js frontend application for the 6529 ecosystem, featuring:
- React/TypeScript codebase
- SCSS styling with Bootstrap
- Complex state management
- NFT and blockchain integrations
- Real-time features with WebSocket

---

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns and conventions
- Use SCSS modules for styling
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

### Testing
- Run tests with appropriate framework commands
- Always check linting and type checking before committing
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes

### Slash Commands
Custom slash commands are available in `.claude/commands/` directory:
- `/brainstorm` - Generate creative ideas and explore approaches
- `/plan` - Create high-level implementation plans
- `/implement` - Provide detailed step-by-step instructions  
- `/review` - Audit implementations against original plans

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `components/` - React components organized by feature
- `pages/` - Next.js pages and API routes
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `services/` - API and external service integrations
- `store/` - State management
- `styles/` - SCSS stylesheets
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions

---

## üîÑ Workflow Recommendations

1. **Research Phase**: Use search tools to understand existing code
2. **Planning Phase**: Use `/brainstorm` and `/plan` for complex tasks
3. **Implementation Phase**: Use `/implement` for detailed execution
4. **Review Phase**: Use `/review` to validate against requirements
5. **Quality Assurance**: Run linting, type checking, and tests

## üìã Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Always read existing code before making changes
- Follow established patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Use TypeScript strictly - avoid `any` types
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibilities

### File Organization
- Place files in appropriate directories based on functionality
- Use consistent naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions
- Group related files together (component + styles + tests)
- Avoid creating unnecessary new files - extend existing ones when possible

### State Management
- Use React hooks appropriately (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Use the existing store pattern for global state
- Avoid prop drilling - use context or state management

### Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Optimize images and media assets
- Use lazy loading for large components

### Security
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, tokens, passwords)
- Validate all user inputs
- Use proper authentication and authorization patterns
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web security

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update existing tests when modifying code
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Test both happy path and error scenarios

### Documentation
- Update comments when changing complex logic
- Document non-obvious business logic
- Keep README files current
- Use JSDoc for complex functions
