# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style & Brand Voice
- **Casual & Community-Centric:** Friendly, approachable, and uses community-specific terminology (e.g., "GM", "Diamond Hands"). We aim to sound like a native of the 6529 community while remaining clear and helpful.

## Visual Identity
- **Modern & Dark-Mode Optimized:** Sleek, high-contrast interfaces that highlight vibrant NFT artwork. The design should prioritize readability and a "premium" digital feel.

## Community Interaction
- **Prominent & Integrated:** Chat and social actions should be easily accessible from most pages. Interaction should feel like a first-class citizen of the experience, not an afterthought.
