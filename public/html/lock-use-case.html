  <h4>How to lock wallet on a specific usecase on a collection?</h4>
  <br />Select a collection from the main page of the Delegations Center.
  Navigate at the bottom of the Manage/View Collection Page and click on the
  Lock/Unlock Use Case dropdown list. Select a Usecase and execute the
  transaction. Your wallet will be locked and it will stop accepting incoming
  delegations on that specific usecase on the specific collection.
  <br /><br />Note: If you want your wallet to not accept incoming delegations
  on a specific usecase for any collection then follow the same steps as
  described above using Any Collections.
