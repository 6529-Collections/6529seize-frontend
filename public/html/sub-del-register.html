    How to register a delegation/sub-delegation/consolidation using
    sub-delegation rights?
  </h4>
  <br />Select a collection from the main page of the Delegation Center and
  navigate to the Sub-delegation area. If you have an incoming sub-delegation
  then certain actions will appear on the Sub-delegations area. To register a
  delegation using sub-delegation rights select the delegator address for which
  you want to register a new delegation and then click the Register Delegation
  button. On the form select the collection for which you want to register a
  delegation on behalf of the Delegator, insert the wallet address, select the
  Use Case, select the expiry date and specify if the new delegation refers to
  all tokens owned by the delegator or a specific token. Once all fields are
  filled execute the transaction. <br /><br />Note: For registering a
  sub-delegation or consolidation click on the Register Sub-Delegation or the
  Register Consolidation buttons, select a Collection Address and insert a
  wallet address.
