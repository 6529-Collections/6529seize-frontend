# Terms of Service Display PRD

## Overview
This product update addresses a critical UX and legal gap in the current drop submission flow. Currently, when users submit content to waves that require terms acceptance, they cryptographically sign terms they haven't been shown. This update will implement a Terms of Service display modal that shows users the terms they're agreeing to before requesting their signature, ensuring informed consent and legal compliance.

## Core Features

### Terms of Service Modal
- **What it does**: Displays the wave's terms of service in a modal before requesting a wallet signature
- **Why it's important**: Ensures users have actually seen the terms they're signing, addressing both legal and UX concerns
- **How it works**: When submitting a drop to a wave that requires terms signature, a modal appears showing the full terms content with an explicit acknowledgment checkbox

### Terms Acknowledgment
- **What it does**: Requires explicit user confirmation that they've read and agree to the terms
- **Why it's important**: Provides clear evidence of informed consent
- **How it works**: Users must check a consent checkbox before proceeding to the signature step

### Signature Context
- **What it does**: Improves the signature request UX by explaining what is being signed
- **Why it's important**: Reduces user confusion and potential signature rejections
- **How it works**: Adds context in the signing flow about what the signature represents (agreement to terms)

## User Experience

### User Personas
- **Content Creators**: Users submitting content to waves with legal requirements
- **Wave Creators**: Users who set up waves with terms requirements
- **Community Managers**: Users who oversee compliance and user experience

### Key User Flows
1. **Terms Acceptance Flow**:
   - User creates a drop in a wave with terms requirements
   - Upon submission, a modal appears displaying the full terms
   - User must check an "I agree" checkbox
   - After checking, the signature request is sent to wallet
   - User signs, and the drop is submitted with the signature

2. **Wave Creation Flow** (existing):
   - Wave creator sets terms in the wave creation interface
   - When enabled, all participants will see these terms before submitting

### UI/UX Considerations
- Modal should be clearly designed with readable typography
- Terms should be scrollable if lengthy, with clear indication of scrollability
- Checkbox must be unchecked by default (no dark patterns)
- Clear explanation of what signing means in user-friendly language
- Mobile-responsive design for all screens

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
- **TermsOfServiceModal**: React component that displays terms and handles acknowledgment
- **useTermsSignatureFlow**: Custom hook to manage the terms display, acknowledgment, and signature process
- **DropSubmissionManager**: Enhanced version of current submission logic to incorporate terms display

### Data Models
- **TermsAcknowledgment**:
  ```typescript
  interface TermsAcknowledgment {
    hasAcknowledged: boolean;
    acknowledgedAt: number | null;
    termsVersion: string; // Hash of terms content for tracking changes
  }
  ```

### APIs and Integrations
- Leverages existing wallet signature APIs
- Enhances current drop submission flow with terms confirmation step
- No additional backend changes required (uses existing terms stored in wave configuration)

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Frontend-only implementation
- No additional backend services needed

## Development Roadmap

### MVP Requirements
1. **Terms Modal Component**:
   - Create reusable modal component for displaying terms
   - Implement scrollable terms content area
   - Add acknowledgment checkbox
   - Include "Agree & Continue" and "Cancel" buttons

2. **Terms Signature Flow Integration**:
   - Modify `useDropSignature` hook to incorporate terms display step
   - Update drop submission logic to display terms before signature request
   - Ensure terms are properly included in signature hash

3. **Submission Process Update**:
   - Update `prepareAndSubmitDrop` function to show terms when required
   - Modify signature request to include context about what's being signed
   - Handle cancellations and rejections gracefully

### Future Enhancements
1. **Terms Versioning**:
   - Track when users have agreed to specific terms versions
   - Notify users when terms have changed since last agreement

2. **Terms Format Improvements**:
   - Support for rich text/markdown in terms display
   - Add section navigation for lengthy terms

3. **Analytics**:
   - Track terms view time and acceptance rate
   - Identify potential friction points in the terms acceptance flow

## Logical Dependency Chain

1. **Foundation** (Build First):
   - Terms display modal component
   - Terms acknowledgment state management
   - Integration with existing signature flow

2. **Getting to Usable Frontend**:
   - Implement the basic terms display in the drop submission flow
   - Ensure mobile and desktop compatibility
   - Test with various terms lengths

3. **Feature Pacing**:
   - Phase 1: Basic terms display and acknowledgment (MVP)
   - Phase 2: Improved formatting and readability
   - Phase 3: Versioning and analytics

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Modal state management across the complex drop submission flow
  - **Mitigation**: Use a centralized state management approach for the terms flow

- **Risk**: Ensuring terms are properly included in signature hash
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing of the signature payload

- **Risk**: Mobile UX challenges with limited screen space
  - **Mitigation**: Responsive design with careful attention to mobile experience

### MVP Approach
- **Risk**: Adding friction to the drop submission process
  - **Mitigation**: Streamlined UX that makes terms review quick and painless while still effective

- **Risk**: User confusion about what they're signing
  - **Mitigation**: Clear explanatory text and confirmation UI

### Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: Potential scope creep beyond the basic legal requirement
  - **Mitigation**: Clear MVP definition focused on the core legal/UX need

## Appendix

### Research Findings
- Current flow has users signing terms they haven't seen
- AgreementStep component in the Memes submission flow provides a good pattern to follow
- Legal best practices require explicit display and acknowledgment of terms before signature

### Technical Specifications
- Integration points:
  - CreateDropContent.tsx (prepareAndSubmitDrop function)
  - useDropSignature.ts (signDrop function)
  - DropHasher.ts (hash function)
- Existing terms data location: wave.participation.terms
