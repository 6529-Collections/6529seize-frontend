# Codex Docs Index

Use this catalogue to keep long-lived documentation easy to discover. Group entries by year (preferred) or topic, and link directly to the underlying Markdown artefacts.

## 2025

- _No archived documents yet. Add entries in the format `YYYY-MM-DD â€“ Title (owner)` pointing to the corresponding file._

---

### How to Update

- Add a new section when a year or topic gains documents.
- Keep the list sorted chronologically within each section.
- Link related tickets and PRs inline so reviewers can understand why the document exists.
