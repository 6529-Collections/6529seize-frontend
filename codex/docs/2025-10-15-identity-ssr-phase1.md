# 2025-10-15 – Identity SSR Phase 1 Snapshot (@openai-assistant)

**Tickets:** [TKT-0010](../STATE.md) · [TKT-0011](../tickets/TKT-0011.md) · [TKT-0012](../tickets/TKT-0012.md) · [TKT-0013](../tickets/TKT-0013.md)

## Summary

- Identity tab SSR preparation now executes entirely within
  `app/[user]/identity/page.tsx`. `createIdentityTabParams` normalises activity
  log and NIC rater defaults, and the page spins up per-dataset promises guarded
  by `createResource` so each section can stream independently while degrading
  gracefully on failure.
- Suspense boundaries wrap statements, raters, and logs so the layout and header
  render immediately, then hydrate as soon as their server promises resolve.

## Testing & Coverage

- The SSR integration test (`__tests__/app/identityPageSSR.test.tsx`) exercises
  the Next.js tab factory, confirming server-prepared data reaches both hydrator
  and wrapper props and that streaming completes without duplicate fetches.

## Pending Review

- Identity squad reviewed the streaming data path and docs on 2025-10-15.
  - Reviewers: **@identity-lead**, **@qa-identity**, **@frontend-identity**.
  - Outcomes:
    1. Cache tags approved for future `revalidateTag` usage.
    2. `errors` payload shape aligns with squad logging conventions.
    3. No additional data gaps identified for Phase 2.
