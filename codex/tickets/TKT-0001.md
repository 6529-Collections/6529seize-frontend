title: Audit client-side processing for server migration

## Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
The `__tests__/components/user/stats/UserPageStats.fetch.test.tsx` suite is failing and needs to be brought back in sync with the current component behaviour without modifying source files.

## Plan

- [x] Reproduce the failing test cases and capture current failure output.
- [x] Compare assertions with actual `UserPageStats` fetch behaviour to spot mismatches.
- [x] Update the tests to match the production logic while preserving meaningful coverage.
- [x] Re-run the affected test suite (and broader checks if needed) to ensure green results.

## Acceptance

- [x] All updated tests pass locally via `npm run test` or the relevant targeted command.
- [x] Test assertions reflect real component behaviour and cover the intended scenarios.
=======
> The team is migrating processing workloads from the client to the server to improve perceived performance. We need an inventory of client-side processing that should shift server-side, ranked by impact on user experience.

## Plan

- [x] Confirm scope and capture initial repository context.
- [x] Catalogue client-side processing hotspots and evaluate move-to-server impact.
- [x] Distill findings into documentation and share recommended next steps.

## Acceptance

- [x] Comprehensive list of client-side processing suitable for server migration, ranked by user impact.
- [x] Document stored under `codex/docs/` with clear action recommendations.
- [x] State board reflects latest ticket state and links to output document.
