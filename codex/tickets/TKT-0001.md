title: Align UserPageStats fetch tests with implementation
---

## Context

The `__tests__/components/user/stats/UserPageStats.fetch.test.tsx` suite is failing and needs to be brought back in sync with the current component behaviour without modifying source files.

## Plan

- [x] Reproduce the failing test cases and capture current failure output.
- [x] Compare assertions with actual `UserPageStats` fetch behaviour to spot mismatches.
- [x] Update the tests to match the production logic while preserving meaningful coverage.
- [x] Re-run the affected test suite (and broader checks if needed) to ensure green results.

## Acceptance

- [x] All updated tests pass locally via `npm run test` or the relevant targeted command.
- [x] Test assertions reflect real component behaviour and cover the intended scenarios.
