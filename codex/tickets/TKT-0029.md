title: Remove unused immediatelyNextMintInstantUTC helper
---

## Context

> Knip's unused export report flags `immediatelyNextMintInstantUTC` in `components/meme-calendar/meme-calendar.helpers.tsx`. We need to confirm whether it is dead code and clean it up accordingly.

## Plan

- [x] Verify repository usage of `immediatelyNextMintInstantUTC` and determine proper action.
- [x] Update helpers and dependent code as needed, then validate quality checks.

## Acceptance

- [x] `immediatelyNextMintInstantUTC` is either removed or made internal based on confirmed usage.
- [x] No remaining documentation references advertise the helper as an export.
- [x] Linting, type checks, and targeted tests pass.
