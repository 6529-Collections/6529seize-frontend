title: Refactor wave group edit buttons for modular clarity
---

## Context

> The `WaveGroupEditButtons` component has accreted mixed responsibilities spanning UI composition, event wiring, and conditional logic. This refactor extracts reusable building blocks while preserving runtime behaviour, visuals, and typing guarantees.

## Plan

- [x] Audit existing component structure, state and handler responsibilities.
- [x] Propose modular breakdown across subcomponents, hooks, and helpers aligned with project conventions.
- [x] Implement refactor with behaviour parity and updated imports/exports.
- [ ] Validate via linting, type-checks, and targeted tests as required.

## Acceptance

- [ ] `WaveGroupEditButtons` rebuilt as a composition shell delegating to extracted modules.
- [ ] Behaviour, styling, and TypeScript typings remain unchanged.
- [ ] Tests, lint, and type-check commands succeed without new warnings.
