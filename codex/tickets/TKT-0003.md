title: Server aggregate collection analytics surfaces
---

## Context

> Collection dashboards (MemeLab, 6529 Gradient, timelines) fetch thousands of records to the browser and perform expensive sorts and aggregations client-side, resulting in long spinners and heavy payloads. Centralising computation server-side enables caching and faster initial paint.

## Plan

- [ ] Catalogue required analytics outputs and normalise contracts across collection surfaces.
- [ ] Implement server handlers that provide pre-sorted/aggregated datasets with pagination.
- [ ] Introduce caching and invalidation for volatile metrics (floor price, recent sales, etc.).
- [ ] Update React components to consume lightweight server payloads and drop redundant client transforms.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Collection pages load using server-provided datasets under agreed latency targets on cold cache.
- [ ] Cached responses or background jobs avoid downloading full datasets per visitor.
- [ ] Client bundles no longer include the legacy `fetchAllPages` loops for these surfaces.
