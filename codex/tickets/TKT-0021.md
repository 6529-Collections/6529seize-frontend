title: Remove unused HeaderNotifications component
---

## Context

> Knip reported `components/header/notifications/HeaderNotifications.tsx` as unused. We need to confirm the component has no runtime references and remove any dead code, including related tests.

## Plan

- [x] Confirm `HeaderNotifications` has no production references.
- [x] Remove the unused component and associated tests.
- [ ] Update forward references or documentation if required.

## Acceptance

- [ ] `components/header/notifications/HeaderNotifications.tsx` and its tests are removed.
- [ ] No lingering imports or exports reference the deleted module.
- [ ] Knip no longer flags the removed file as unused.
