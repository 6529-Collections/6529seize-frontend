title: Reconcile Codex board merge conflicts
---

## Context

> A merge introduced conflicting updates between local work and `main`, leaving `codex/STATE.md` and TKT-0001 out of sync. We need to resolve the conflicts and capture the effort as a tracked ticket.

## Plan

- [ ] Inspect `codex/STATE.md` and impacted ticket files to confirm the canonical data.
- [ ] Remove merge conflict markers and restore the authoritative TKT-0001 content.
- [ ] Append this ticket to the state board with aligned metadata.

## Acceptance

- [ ] No merge conflict markers remain in the codex state board or related tickets.
- [ ] `codex/STATE.md` lists TKT-0008 with matching metadata to this ticket.
- [ ] Ticket log records the conflict resolution steps.
