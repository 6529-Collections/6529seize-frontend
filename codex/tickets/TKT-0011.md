title: Improve header search result ordering
---

## Context

> Ensure the header search modal surfaces exact matches ahead of broader results and orders result categories by their relative size to improve discoverability.

## Plan

- [ ] Audit the existing header search ordering for both item and category grouping logic.
- [ ] Adjust the ranking to prioritize exact matches and sort categories with fewer results first.
- [ ] Update or add tests covering the new ordering behaviors.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Exact query matches appear before partial matches in the header search results.
- [ ] Categories in the header search modal are ordered by ascending result counts.
- [ ] Relevant tests are updated or added, and `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run type-check` pass.
