title: Replace notification polling with server-driven delivery
---

## Context

> Notification drawers and wave activity logs rely on `useInfiniteQuery` polling loops with 5 s timers, leading to duplicated network traffic per tab and wasted battery. Consolidating delivery server-side enables push-based updates and shared diff logic.

## Plan

- [ ] Evaluate websocket vs server-sent events for notification delivery and authentication.
- [ ] Build consolidated server endpoints or streams that emit diffed notification payloads.
- [ ] Update client hooks to consume push-driven updates and remove polling timers.
- [ ] Roll out backoff/health monitoring to catch delivery regressions.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Clients stop issuing periodic REST polls for notifications or wave activity.
- [ ] Server components or shared stores surface push notifications with correct auth scoping.
- [ ] Monitoring confirms reduced duplicate traffic and stable delivery latency.
