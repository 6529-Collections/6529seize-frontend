title: Fix wave group menu overflow clipping
---

## Context

The wave eligibility panel shows an always-on scrollbar and the gear dropdown for each group gets clipped by the scroll container, hiding the “Remove group” option.

## Plan

- [x] Tweak the scroll container styling so it does not render a scrollbar by default while still allowing scroll when needed.
- [x] Adjust the gear dropdown positioning to stay visible when near the container edges.
- [ ] Validate the behaviour manually and with automated checks.

## Acceptance

- [x] The eligibility list renders without the persistent white scrollbar in supported browsers.
- [x] Opening any gear menu keeps the dropdown fully visible regardless of scroll position.
- [ ] Lint, tests, and type-check pass.

## Log

- 2025-10-15T08:37:39Z – Captured scrollbar and dropdown clipping bug; fix in progress.
- 2025-10-15T08:49:09Z – Adjusted scroll container styling and dropdown placement; lint/test pass, type-check blocked by existing errors.
- 2025-10-15T09:45:12Z – Portaled the menu outside the scroll container, reran checks; type-check still fails due to legacy test definitions.
- 2025-10-15T10:22:03Z – Replaced the custom portal with Headless UI’s anchored menu to restore the gear dropdown; updated tests and reran lint/test (type-check still blocked upstream).
