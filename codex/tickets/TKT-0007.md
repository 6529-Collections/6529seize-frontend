title: Stabilize group name search input
---

## Context

> Typing into the "By Group Name" search field freezes the browser and drops characters because each keystroke appears to trigger a full route change, causing race conditions between the URL and the input state.

## Plan

- [x] Reproduce the input lag locally and capture the triggering code path.
- [x] Identify existing debounce/search handling helpers that can be reused.
- [x] Apply the minimal fix to keep the input responsive without extra reloads.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Typing into the "By Group Name" search box remains responsive with no missed characters.
- [ ] Search results continue updating to reflect the current query.
