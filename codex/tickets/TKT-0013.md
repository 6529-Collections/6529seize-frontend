title: Implement identity SSR streaming and mutations
---

## Context

> Phase 3 of the identity tab SSR roadmap introduces caching, streaming, and server-action backed mutations to minimise client work while keeping optimistic UX intact.

## Plan

- [ ] Add route-level caching and revalidation tags for identity tab data sources.
- [ ] Implement server actions (or equivalent API wrappers) for statements CRUD and raters/activity filters with progressive enhancement fallbacks.
- [ ] Wire metrics/observability around SSR execution, cache hit rate, and hydration payload size.
- [ ] Validate optimistic UI flows when mutations trigger partial revalidation.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Identity tab benefits from cache hits on revisit; instrumentation captures hit/miss ratios.
- [ ] Server-backed mutations succeed with fallbacks for unsupported cases, and UI remains responsive.
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards or logs document SSR performance improvements.
