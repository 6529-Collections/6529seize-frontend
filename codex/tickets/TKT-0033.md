title: Remove unused createIcsDataUrl helper
---

## Context

> Knip reports `createIcsDataUrl` in `components/meme-calendar/meme-calendar.helpers.tsx` as an unused export. We need to confirm whether the helper is dead code and remove it if so.

## Plan

- [x] Confirm whether `createIcsDataUrl` is referenced anywhere in the project.
- [x] Remove the helper or drop the export while keeping internal usages working.
- [x] Update or delete any affected tests or documentation.

## Acceptance

- [x] `createIcsDataUrl` is either proven necessary or removed without breaking the build.
- [x] Lint, tests, and type checks succeed after the change.

## Log

- 2025-10-28T17:15:00Z – Ticket created for investigating the unused export flag raised by Knip.
- 2025-10-28T17:45:00Z – Confirmed the helper is only used within the module, dropped the export, refreshed the README summary, and validated with targeted lint, related Jest suites, and a full TypeScript check.
