title: Centralise media and IPFS upload orchestration
---

## Context

> Large media uploads currently chunk, retry, and infer metadata entirely in the browser via presigned URLs, which is brittle on slow networks and lacks server-side validation. Delegating orchestration to a server gateway will improve reliability and security controls.

## Plan

- [ ] Design a resumable upload service that handles chunking, retries, and content-type detection server-side.
- [ ] Integrate virus scanning, quota enforcement, and logging into the upload pipeline.
- [ ] Update client flows to request upload tokens, stream files to the gateway, and surface progress.
- [ ] Provide migration playbook for existing presigned direct upload callers.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Browser clients delegate chunk management to the server gateway while retaining progress UX.
- [ ] Server uploads enforce validation (size, MIME, scanning) before persisting artifacts.
- [ ] Observability dashboards capture success/error rates for the new upload path.
