title: Replace wave publish wait with backend confirmation
---

## Context

> A temporary client-side wait was introduced after publishing wave groups to mask backend read-after-write lag. The delay adds latency and is brittle; we need deterministic confirmation from the server instead.

## Plan

- [ ] Confirm expected backend guarantee (read-after-write or publish event) with platform team.
- [ ] Implement client-side integration for the confirmed signal, removing the synthetic wait.
- [ ] Validate publish flows against multiple wave group edits to ensure consistency without the delay.
- [ ] Coordinate rollout ahead of the removal deadline (2025-11-08) and monitor for regressions.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Publishing wave groups relies on deterministic backend confirmation rather than fixed waits.
- [ ] All previous consumer flows remain functionally equivalent and free from timing regressions.
- [ ] Validation steps complete without new lint, type, or test issues.
