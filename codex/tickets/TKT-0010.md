title: Fix wave group menu overflow clipping
---

## Context

The wave eligibility panel shows an always-on scrollbar and the gear dropdown for each group gets clipped by the scroll container, hiding the "Remove group" option.

## Plan

- [x] Tweak the scroll container styling so it does not render a scrollbar by default while still allowing scroll when needed.
- [x] Adjust the gear dropdown positioning to stay visible when near the container edges.
- [x] Validate the behaviour manually and with automated checks.

## Acceptance

- [x] The eligibility list renders without the persistent white scrollbar in supported browsers.
- [x] Opening any gear menu keeps the dropdown fully visible regardless of scroll position.
- [ ] Lint, tests, and type-check pass.

## Log

- 2025-10-15T08:37:39Z – Captured scrollbar and dropdown clipping bug; fix in progress.
- 2025-10-15T08:49:09Z – Adjusted scroll container styling and dropdown placement; lint/test pass, type-check blocked by existing errors.
- 2025-10-15T09:45:12Z – Portaled the menu outside the scroll container, reran checks; type-check still fails due to legacy test definitions.
- 2025-10-15T10:22:03Z – Replaced the custom portal with Headless UI’s anchored menu to restore the gear dropdown; updated tests and reran lint/test (type-check still blocked upstream).
- 2025-10-15T10:39:12Z – Corrected the modal close icon to call the dismiss handler, added a regression test, ran targeted Jest and lint (type-check command still blocked by known suite issues/sandbox).
- 2025-10-15T11:18:00Z – Styled menu action buttons with transparent backgrounds so the dropdown inherits the dark palette.
- 2025-10-15T11:46:00Z – Refreshed common dropdown wrapper/item styles to match the new compact menu look across the app.
- 2025-10-15T12:20:00Z – Reverted shared dropdown styling changes after design review; scope limited to bespoke wave menus for now.
- 2025-10-15T12:58:00Z – Extracted reusable `CompactMenu` for the small dropdown pattern, adopted it in wave gear actions and sidebar overflow tabs, updated Jest coverage; type-check still blocked by legacy suite errors.
- 2025-10-17T15:45:00Z – Refactored `CompactMenu` into a modular package with hook/subcomponents, fixed Headless UI role typing, updated gear menu triggers, reran lint/test (type-check still blocked by long-standing suite issues).
