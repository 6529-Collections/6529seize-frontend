title: Unify header search results
---

## Context

> Ensure the header search modal surfaces exact matches ahead of broader results and orders result categories by their relative size to improve discoverability.

## Plan

- [x] Audit the existing header search ordering for both item and category grouping logic.
- [x] Adjust the ranking to prioritize exact matches and sort categories with fewer results first.
- [x] Update or add tests covering the new ordering behaviors.

## Acceptance

- [x] Exact query matches appear before partial matches in the header search results.
- [x] Categories in the header search modal are ordered by ascending result counts.
- [x] Desktop header search modal maintains fixed tab and results widths with truncated primary text to avoid column shifts.
- [x] Relevant tests are updated or added, and `npm run test` and `npm run lint` pass.

## Log

- 2025-10-24T09:46:52Z – Initialized ticket and outlined ordering improvements.
- 2025-10-24T10:45:00Z – Implemented page icons, scroll locking, and loading-state polish for the header search modal alongside updated tests.
- 2025-10-24T12:50:50Z – Redesigned desktop modal layout with vertical filtering, integrated inline clear control, and lowered NFT search thresholds while keeping the test suite healthy.
- 2025-10-27T09:22:32Z – Locked desktop search modal columns, ensured long primary text truncates cleanly, and queued regressions for follow-up validation once the suite stabilises.
