title: Remove unused getNextMintNumber helper
---

## Context

> Knip flags the `getNextMintNumber` export in `components/meme-calendar/meme-calendar.helpers.tsx` as unused. We need to confirm the helper is dead code and delete it or adjust visibility accordingly.

## Plan

- [x] Confirm whether `getNextMintNumber` is referenced in the application or tests.
- [x] Remove the helper and related exports if unused, or adjust its scope if still needed.
- [x] Update the ticket with findings and verification steps.

## Acceptance

- [x] Helper is removed or scoped appropriately with no remaining unused export warnings from Knip for this symbol.
- [x] Unit tests, linting, and type checks continue to pass.
