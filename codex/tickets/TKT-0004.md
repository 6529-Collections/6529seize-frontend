title: Offload CSV mapping tools to server pipelines
---

## Context

> Delegation and consolidation mapping tools parse large CSVs in-browser, then paginate through full datasets with `fetchAllPages`, causing UI stalls, memory pressure, and duplicated business rules. Moving processing server-side will improve reliability and secure long-running jobs.

## Plan

- [ ] Design authenticated upload workflow (signed URLs or direct POST) and queue semantics.
- [ ] Build server workers that merge CSV inputs with delegation/consolidation datasets and emit results.
- [ ] Expose download or notification flows for processed artifacts and update client UX accordingly.
- [ ] Implement throttling/monitoring to protect upstream APIs during batch processing.

## Acceptance

- [ ] CSV ingestion, lookup, and merging execute on the server without blocking the browser.
- [ ] Client-side tools limit work to upload progress, status polling, and result presentation.
- [ ] Operational runbooks cover scaling limits, retries, and user support for failed jobs.
