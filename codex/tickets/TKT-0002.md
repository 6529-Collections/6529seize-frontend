title: Server-side hydrate brain and wave pipelines
---

## Context

> Infinite queries and merge logic for the brain feed and wave experiences currently execute in the browser, duplicating work across tabs and delaying first contentful render. Moving hydration and merge queues to the server should reduce latency and simplify clients.

## Plan

- [ ] Align with platform team on authenticated server fetch strategy for feed data.
- [ ] Build server components or route handlers that deliver initial feed and wave payloads.
- [ ] Stream incremental updates (SSE/websocket) and remove client-side merge/retry queues.
- [ ] Add telemetry covering server-side fetch latency and payload size regressions.

## Acceptance

- [ ] First-page feed rendering occurs server-side with no redundant client polling before content appears.
- [ ] Wave merge and dropout reconciliation logic lives in shared server utilities consumed by clients.
- [ ] Observability dashboards confirm latency and payload size improvements versus the client baseline.
