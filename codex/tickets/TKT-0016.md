title: Upgrade Next.js app to version 16
---

> Upgrade the frontend to Next.js 16 using the provided Next Devtools automation so we can adopt the latest React 19 runtime and platform tooling.

## Plan

- [x] Run the Next.js 16 upgrade automation and review generated diffs.
- [x] Address any manual follow-ups required by the codemod.
- [x] Validate the application by running tests, lint, and type-check.

## Acceptance

- [x] `next` and related dependencies updated to version 16 and app boots locally.
- [x] `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run type-check` pass without errors.
- [x] Documented the upgrade outcome and any required follow-ups.

## Log

- 2025-10-27T12:46:40Z – Ticket opened to track the Next.js 16 upgrade.
- 2025-10-27T12:58:02Z – Ran the official Next.js codemod (upgrade latest); dependencies bumped and middleware renamed to proxy.tsx pending follow-up checks.
- 2025-10-27T13:19:35Z – Completed lint config migration and scripts updates; lint/type-check green but `npm run test` now fails across multiple suites under React 19 assertions (e.g., stricter accessibility expectations).
- 2025-10-28T05:33:50Z – Re-ran `npm run test`; 7 suites/14 tests still failing (e.g., `CommonProfileSearchItem` alt text expectation). `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` succeed with warnings only.
- 2025-10-28T06:01:42Z – Addressed React 19/Headless UI test updates (profile search, dropdowns, wave group controllers, tab overflow); mocks now align with TanStack v5 APIs. `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run type-check` all pass (lint warnings persist).
