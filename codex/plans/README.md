# Planning Document Guide

Planning artefacts in this directory provide a lightweight structure for organising tickets into time-boxed initiatives (sprints, OKRs, releases).

## Naming Convention

- Weekly plans: `YYYYWW-name.md` (e.g., `2025W41-sprint.md`)
- Quarterly plans: `YYYY-QN-name.md` (e.g., `2025-Q1-growth.md`)

## Recommended Outline

```markdown

## Best Practices

- Reference ticket IDs consistently so readers can jump to the source ticket record.
- Note capacity or staffing risks early and keep this file updated after standups or planning meetings.
- Archive completed plans in place—do not delete them. They serve as historical context for future planning cycles.
