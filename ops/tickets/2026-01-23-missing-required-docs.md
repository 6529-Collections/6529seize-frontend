# Missing required ops/AGENTS docs

- Date: 2026-01-23
- Reported by: codex
- Context: Repo rules require reading `AGENTS.md`, `ops/readme.md`, and `ops/tickets/README.md` before changes.

## Issue
Those required files are missing in the repository. This blocks the mandated read-before-write workflow.

## Requested action
Add the required files (and any expected templates) or update the repo rules to match the actual layout.
