# Missing required agent docs

- Date: 2026-01-22
- Context: PR #1800 (EvoResolver - lodash bump)

## Problem
Required repository guidance files are missing:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `ops/readme.md`
- `ops/tickets/README.md`

These are explicitly required to be read before changes. Their absence blocks full compliance with the agent operating rules.

## Requested action
Create the missing files (or point to their correct locations) and document the intended workflow for agents.
